* Breast cancer can spread when the cancer cells get into the blood or lymph system and then are carried to other parts of the body.Â 
* The lymph (or lymphatic) system is a part of your body's immune system. It is a network of lymph nodes (small, bean-sized glands), ducts or vessels, and organs that work together to collect and carry clear lymph fluid through the body tissues to the blood. The clear lymph fluid inside the lymph vessels contains tissue by-products and waste material, as well as immune system cells.
* The lymph vessels carry lymph fluid away from the breast. In the case of breast cancer, cancer cells can enter those lymph vessels and start to grow in lymph nodes. Most of the lymph vessels of the breast drain into:
* Lymph nodes under the arm (axillary lymph nodes)
* Lymph nodes inside the chest near the breastbone (internal mammary lymph nodes)
* Lymph nodes around the collar bone (supraclavicular \[above the collar bone] and infraclavicular \[below the collar bone] lymph nodes)
* If cancer cells have spread to your lymph nodes, there is a higher chance that the cells could have traveled through the lymph system and spread (metastasized) to other parts of your body. Still, not all women with cancer cells in their lymph nodes develop metastases, and some women with no cancer cells in their lymph nodes might develop metastases later.
