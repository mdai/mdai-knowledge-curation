Researchers around the world are working to find better ways to prevent, detect, and treat breast cancer, and to improve the quality of life of patients and survivors.

* Research studies

  * Current guidance on preventing and treating breast cancer as well as what might cause it (among other things) has come mainly from information discovered from research studies. Research studies can range from studies done in the lab to clinical trials done with hundreds of thousands of people. Clinical trials are carefully controlled studies that can gather specific information about certain diseases as well as explore promising new treatments.
  * Clinical trials are one way to get the latest cancer treatments that are being investigated. Still, they are not right for everyone. If you would like to learn more about clinical trials that might be right for you, start by asking your doctor if your clinic or hospital conducts clinical trials, or see Clinical Trials to learn more.
* Breast cancer causes

  * Studies continue to look at how certain lifestyle factors, habits, and other environmental factors, as well as inherited gene changes, might affect breast cancer risk. Here are a few examples:
  * Several studies are looking at the effects of physical activity, weight gain or loss, and diet on breast cancer risk.
  * Some breast cancers run in families, but many of the gene mutations (changes) that cause these breast cancers are not yet known. Research is being done to identify these gene changes.
  * Several studies are focusing on the best use of genetic testing for inherited breast cancer gene mutations.
  * Scientists are exploring how common gene variants (small changes in genes that are not as significant as mutations) may affect breast cancer risk. Gene variants typically have only a modest effect on risk by themselves, but when combined they could possibly have a large impact.
  * Possible environmental causes of breast cancer have also received more attention in recent years. While much of the science on this topic is still in its earliest stages, this is an area of active research.
* Breast cancer prevention

  * Researchers are looking for ways to help reduce breast cancer risk, especially for women who are at high risk. Here are some examples:
  * Studies continue to look at whether certain levels of physical activity, losing weight, or eating certain foods, groups of foods, or types of diets might help lower breast cancer risk.
  * Some hormonal medicines such as tamoxifen, raloxifene, exemestane, and anastrozole have already been shown to help lower breast cancer risk for certain women at higher risk. Researchers continue to study which groups of women might benefit most from these drugs.
  * Clinical trials are also looking at whether some non-hormonal drugs might lower breast cancer risk, such as drugs used to treat blood or bone marrow disorders, like ruxolitinib.
  * Studies are looking at vaccines that might help prevent certain types of breast cancer.
* New tests to personalize your treatment

  * Biomarkers

  * Breast cancer tissue is routinely tested for the biomarkers ER, PR, and HER2 to help make treatment decisions. A biomarker is any gene, protein, or other substance that can be measured in blood, tissues, or other body fluids. 
  * Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is DNA that is released into the bloodstream when cancer cells die. Identifying and testing the ctDNA in the blood for biomarkers is a rapidly growing area of study.
  * Some ways ctDNA might potentially be used in breast cancer including:
  * Looking for new biomarkers in the tumor cells that might mean the cancer has become resistant to specific treatments (like chemo or targeted drug therapy)
  * Determining if a certain drug will work on a tumor before trying it
  * Predicting if the breast cancer will recur (come back) in women with early-stage breast cancer
  * Predicting if neoadjuvant treatment is working  to destroy the tumor instead of using imaging tests like a CT scan or US
  * Determining if breast cancer or a high-risk breast condition is present before changes are found on an imaging test like a mammogram
* New imaging tests

Newer types of tests are being developed for breast imaging. Some of these are already being used in certain situations, while others are still being studied. It will take time to see if they are as good as or better than those used today. Some of these tests include:

* Scintimammography (molecular breast imaging) 
* Positron emission mammography (PEM)
* Electrical impedance imaging (EIT)
* Elastography
* New types of optical imaging tests 
* Breast cancer treatment
* New kinds of treatments for breast cancer are always being studied. For example, in recent years, several new targeted drugs have been approved to treat breast cancer.
* But more and better treatment options are needed, especially for cancers like triple-negative breast cancer, where chemotherapy is the main option.

Some areas of research involving breast cancer treatment include:

* Studying if shorter courses of radiation therapy for very early-stage breast cancers are at least as good as the longer courses now often used
* Testing if different types of radiation therapy, such as proton beam radiation, might be better than standard radiation. 
* Combining certain drugs (like 2 targeted drugs, a targeted drug with an immunotherapy drug, or a hormone drug with a targeted drug) to see if they work better together
* Trying to find new drugs or drug combinations that might help treat breast cancer that has spread to the brain
* Testing different immunotherapy drugs to treat triple-negative breast cancer
* Giving cancer vaccines with standard chemotherapy to see if this helps keep the cancer from coming back after treatment 
* Finding new ways to treat women with hereditary breast cancer, since they have a higher chance of the cancer recurring (coming back)
* Determining if chemotherapy is needed to treat every woman with HER2-positive breast cancer
* Finding new treatment options when breast cancer becomes resistant to current treatments

Supportive care
  Supportive care helps patients and caregivers manage the symptoms of cancer and side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are looking at different medicines and techniques to try to improve supportive care for people with breast cancer. For example, some studies are investigating:

* If there are better medicines or ways to prevent the damage to nerves that sometimes happen with certain chemotherapy drugs 
* If drugs or other treatments might be helpful in limiting memory problems and other brain symptoms after chemotherapy
* If certain heart or blood pressure drugs, can help prevent the heart damage sometimes caused by common breast cancer drugs such as doxorubicin and trastuzumab
* If there are medicines that might be able to help treat the tired feeling that cancer can cause

title: Assessment of Ki67 in Breast Cancer: Updated Recommendations From the International Ki67 in Breast Cancer Working Group 
link: JNCI: Journal of the National Cancer Institute, Volume 113, Issue 7, July 2021, Pages 808–819, https://doi.org/10.1093/jnci/djaa201
abstract: Ki67 immunohistochemistry (IHC), commonly used as a proliferation marker in breast cancer, has limited value for treatment decisions due to questionable analytical validity. The International Ki67 in Breast Cancer Working Group (IKWG) consensus meeting, held in October 2019, assessed the current evidence for Ki67 IHC analytical validity and clinical utility in breast cancer, including the series of scoring studies the IKWG conducted on centrally stained tissues. Consensus observations and recommendations are: 1) as for estrogen receptor and HER2 testing, preanalytical handling considerations are critical; 2) a standardized visual scoring method has been established and is recommended for adoption; 3) participation in and evaluation of quality assurance and quality control programs is recommended to maintain analytical validity; and 4) the IKWG accepted that Ki67 IHC as a prognostic marker in breast cancer has clinical validity but concluded that clinical utility is evident only for prognosis estimation in anatomically favorable estrogen receptor–positive and HER2-negative patients to identify those who do not need adjuvant chemotherapy. In this T1-2, N0-1 patient group, the IKWG consensus is that Ki67 5% or less, or 30% or more, can be used to estimate prognosis. In conclusion, analytical validity of Ki67 IHC can be reached with careful attention to preanalytical issues and calibrated standardized visual scoring. Currently, clinical utility of Ki67 IHC in breast cancer care remains limited to prognosis assessment in stage I or II breast cancer. Further development of automated scoring might help to overcome some current limitations.

title: Survival analysis across the entire transcriptome identifies biomarkers with the highest prognostic power in breast cancer
link: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2021.07.014
abstract: Introduction
Extensive research is directed to uncover new biomarkers capable to stratify breast cancer patients into clinically relevant cohorts. However, the overall performance ranking of such marker candidates compared to other genes is virtually absent. Here, we present the ranking of all survival related genes in chemotherapy treated basal and estrogen positive/HER2 negative breast cancer.
Methods
We searched the GEO repository to uncover transcriptomic datasets with available follow-up and clinical data. After quality control and normalization, samples entered an integrated database. Molecular subtypes were designated using gene expression data. Relapse-free survival analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards regression. False discovery rate was computed to combat multiple hypothesis testing. Kaplan-Meier plots were drawn to visualize the best performing genes.
Results
The entire database includes 7,830 unique samples from 55 independent datasets. Of those with available relapse-free survival time, 3,382 samples were estrogen receptor-positive and 696 were basal. In chemotherapy treated ER positive/ERBB2 negative patients the significant prognostic biomarker genes achieved hazard rates between 1.76 and 3.33 with a p value below 5.8E−04. The significant prognostic genes in adjuvant chemotherapy treated basal breast cancer samples reached hazard rates between 1.88 and 3.61 with a p value below 7.2E−04. Our integrated platform was extended enabling the validation of future biomarker candidates.
Conclusions
A reference ranking for all genes in two chemotherapy treated breast cancer cohorts is presented. The results help to neglect those with unlikely clinical significance and to focus future research on the most promising candidates.

title: Identification and validation of immune-related lncRNA prognostic signature for breast cancer
link: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.02.015
abstract: The prognosis of patients with breast cancer is closely related to both the infiltration of immune cells and the expression of lncRNAs. In this study, we evaluated the infiltration of immune cells in 1109 breast cancer samples obtained from TCGA by applying the ssGSEA to the transcriptome of these samples, thereby generating high immune cell infiltration group and low immune cell infiltration group. On the basis of these groupings, we found 696 differentially expressed lncRNAs which were sequentially subjected to univariate Cox regression and stepwise multiple Cox regression analysis. 11 lncRNAs were identified as prognostic signature for breast cancer. Kaplan-Meier analysis, univariate Cox regression, multivariate Cox regression, and ROC analyses further revealed that this 11-lncRNA signature was a novel and important prognostic factor independent of multiple clinicopathological parameters. The TIMER database showed that this 11-lncRNA prognostic signature for breast cancer was associated with the infiltration of immune cell subtypes.

title: Breast cancer: Biology, biomarkers, and treatments
link: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106535
abstract: During the past recent years, various therapies emerged in the era of breast cancer. Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease in which genetic and environmental factors are involved. Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are the main player in the aggressiveness of different tumors and also, these cells are the main challenge in cancer treatment. Moreover, the major obstacle to achieve an effective treatment is resistance to therapies. There are various types of treatment for breast cancer (BC) patients. Therefore, in this review, we present the current treatments, novel approaches such as antibody-drug conjugation systems (ADCs), nanoparticles (albumin-, metal-, lipid-, polymer-, micelle-based nanoparticles), and BCSCs-based therapies. Furthermore, prognostic and predictive biomarkers will be discussed also biomarkers that have been applied by some tests such as Oncotype DX, Mamm αPrint, and uPA/PAI-1 are regarded as suitable prognostic and predictive factors in breast cancer.

title: Pathology of triple negative breast cancer
link: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semcancer.2020.06.005
abstract: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast tumor lacking hormone receptors expression and HER2 gene amplification and represents 24 % of newly diagnosed breast neoplasms. In this review, pathological aspects of triple-negative breast cancer are illustrated, with particular attention to the seminal studies that defined this subtype of breast cancer by a molecular point of view. This paper also focuses on practical issues raised in clinical routine by the introduction of genetic expression breast cancer profiling and the innovative prognostic and predictive impact on triple-negative breast cancer pathology. Moreover, histopathological aspects of triple-negative neoplasms are also mentioned, underlying the importance of histologic diagnosis of particular cancer subtypes with decisive impact on clinical outcome. Importantly, focus on new therapeutic frontier represented by immunotherapy is illustrated, with particular mention of immune checkpoint inhibitors introduction in TNBC therapy and their impact on future treatments.

title: Breast Cancer Treatment

abstract: Breast cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer in women worldwide, and the second most common cause of death from cancer in women in the United States. Risk assessment tools can identify the risk of breast cancer, and patients at high risk may be candidates for risk-reducing medications. The choice of medication varies with menopausal status. Breast cancer treatment depends on the stage. Stage 0 is ductal carcinoma in situ, which is noninvasive but progresses to invasive cancer in up to 40% of patients. Ductal carcinoma in situ is treated with lumpectomy and radiation or with mastectomy. If ductal carcinoma in situ is estrogen receptor–positive, patients may also receive endocrine therapy. Early invasive stages (I, IIa, IIb) and locally advanced stages (IIIa, IIIb, IIIc) are nonmetastatic and have three treatment phases. The preoperative phase uses systemic endocrine or immunotherapies when tumors express estrogen, progesterone, or ERBB2 receptors. Preoperative chemotherapy may also be used and is the only option when tumors have none of those three receptors. There are two options for the surgical phase with similar survival rates; a lumpectomy with radiation if the tumor can be excised completely with good cosmetic results, or a mastectomy. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is also performed when there is suspected nodal disease. The postoperative phase includes radiation, endocrine therapy, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy. Postmenopausal women should also be offered postoperative bisphosphonates. Stage IV (metastatic) breast cancer is treatable but not curable. Treatment goals include improving the length and quality of life.

title: Triple-negative breast cancer molecular subtyping and treatment progress
link: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13058-020-01296-5
abstract: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a specific subtype of breast cancer that does not express estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), has clinical features that include high invasiveness, high metastatic potential, proneness to relapse, and poor prognosis. Because TNBC tumors lack ER, PR, and HER2 expression, they are not sensitive to endocrine therapy or HER2 treatment, and standardized TNBC treatment regimens are still lacking. Therefore, development of new TNBC treatment strategies has become an urgent clinical need. By summarizing existing treatment regimens, therapeutic drugs, and their efficacy for different TNBC subtypes and reviewing some new preclinical studies and targeted treatment regimens for TNBC, this paper aims to provide new ideas for TNBC treatment.

title: Customizing local and systemic therapies for women with early breast cancer: the St. Gallen International Consensus Guidelines for treatment of early breast cancer 2021
link: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.06.023
abstract: The 17th St Gallen International Breast Cancer Consensus Conference in 2021 was held virtually, owing to the global COVID-19 pandemic. More than 3300 participants took part in this important bi-annual critical review of the ‘state of the art’ in the multidisciplinary care of early-stage breast cancer. Seventy-four expert panelists (see Appendix 1) from all continents discussed and commented on the previously elaborated consensus questions, as well as many key questions on early breast cancer diagnosis and treatment asked by the audience. The theme of this year's conference was ‘Customizing local and systemic therapies.’ A well-organized program of pre-recorded symposia, live panel discussions and real-time panel voting results drew a worldwide audience of thousands, reflecting the far-reaching impact of breast cancer on every continent. The interactive technology platform allowed, for the first time, audience members to ask direct questions to panelists, and to weigh in with their own vote on several key panel questions. A hallmark of this meeting was to focus on customized recommendations for treatment of early-stage breast cancer. There is increasing recognition that the care of a breast cancer patient depends on highly individualized clinical features, including the stage at presentation, the biological subset of breast cancer, the genetic factors that may underlie breast cancer risk, the genomic signatures that inform treatment recommendations, the extent of response before surgery in patients who receive neoadjuvant therapy, and patient preferences. This customized approach to treatment requires integration of clinical care between patients and radiology, pathology, genetics, and surgical, medical and radiation oncology providers. It also requires a dynamic response from clinicians as they encounter accumulating clinical information at the time of diagnosis and then serially with each step in the treatment plan and follow-up, reflecting patient experiences and treatment response.

title: Treatment landscape of triple-negative breast cancer — expanded options, evolving needs
link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41571-021-00565-2
abstract: Tumour heterogeneity and a long-standing paucity of effective therapies other than chemotherapy have contributed to triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) being the subtype with the least favourable outcomes. In the past few years, advances in omics technologies have shed light on the relevance of the TNBC microenvironment heterogeneity, unveiling a close dynamic relationship with cancer cell features. An improved understanding of tumour–immune system co-evolution supports the need to adopt a more comprehensive view of TNBC as an ecosystem that encompasses the intrinsic and extrinsic features of cancer cells. This new appreciation of the biology of TNBC has already led to the development of novel targeted agents, including PARP inhibitors, antibody–drug conjugates and immune-checkpoint inhibitors, which are revolutionizing the therapeutic landscape and providing new opportunities both for patients with early-stage TNBC and for those with advanced-stage disease. The current therapeutic scenario is only the tip of the iceberg, as hundreds of new compounds and combinations are in development. The translation of these experimental therapies into clinical benefit is a welcome and ongoing challenge. In this Review, we describe the current and upcoming therapeutic landscape of TNBC and discuss how an integrated view of the TNBC ecosystem can define different levels of risk and provide improved opportunities for tailoring treatment.

title: Breast Cancer—Epidemiology, Risk Factors, Classification, Prognostic Markers, and Current Treatment Strategies—An Updated Review
link: https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13174287
abstract: Simple Summary
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. It is estimated that 2.3 million new cases of BC are diagnosed globally each year. Based on mRNA gene expression levels, BC can be divided into molecular subtypes that provide insights into new treatment strategies and patient stratifications that impact the management of BC patients. This review addresses the overview on the BC epidemiology, risk factors, classification with an emphasis on molecular types, prognostic biomarkers, as well as possible treatment modalities.
Abstract
Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women worldwide with more than 2 million new cases in 2020. Its incidence and death rates have increased over the last three decades due to the change in risk factor profiles, better cancer registration, and cancer detection. The number of risk factors of BC is significant and includes both the modifiable factors and non-modifiable factors. Currently, about 80% of patients with BC are individuals aged >50. Survival depends on both stage and molecular subtype. Invasive BCs comprise wide spectrum tumors that show a variation concerning their clinical presentation, behavior, and morphology. Based on mRNA gene expression levels, BC can be divided into molecular subtypes (Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched, and basal-like). The molecular subtypes provide insights into new treatment strategies and patient stratifications that impact the management of BC patients. The eighth edition of TNM classification outlines a new staging system for BC that, in addition to anatomical features, acknowledges biological factors. Treatment of breast cancer is complex and involves a combination of different modalities including surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or biological therapies delivered in diverse sequences.
