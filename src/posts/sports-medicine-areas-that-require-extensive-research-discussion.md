1. **Transgender People in Sports** 

The participation of [transgender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender) people in [competitive sports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_sports) is a controversial issue, particularly the inclusion of [transgender women and girls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_women) in [women's sports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_sports).

Opponents argue that transgender women have an unfair advantage over, and may endanger, [cisgender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisgender) women in competitive sports due to [sex differences in human physiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_human_physiology), and that these differences are not sufficiently reversed by [transgender hormone therapies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_hormone_therapy). Supporters of transgender athletes argue that medically prescribed [puberty blockers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty_blocker) and [estrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen) suppress testosterone levels and reduce the muscle mass of transgender women, reducing possible competitive advantages. Supporters also argue that sport, particularly youth sports, is also about belonging, well-being, and socialization of young people. The [American Medical Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Medical_Association) states that legislation barring trans women from women's sports harms the mental health of transgender people.

As of April 2023, there is no unifying international framework for the participation of transgender people in competitive sports. Traditionally, the inclusion criteria for women's sports have been decided upon by [individual sporting bodies at the national and international level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_verification_in_sports). Some U.S. states have passed legislation restricting the participation of [transgender youth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_youth) in high school sports or of trans women and girls in women's sports and several international governing bodies including [World Athletics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics), [World Aquatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Aquatics) and [World Rugby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Rugby) have restricted trans women who had undergone male puberty from participating in the female category.

2. **Drugs in Sports:** The most common prohibited substances for doping in sport are [Anabolic steroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolic_steroid) (most common), which increase muscle mass and physical strength, and s[timulants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant) (second most common), which increase excitement and decrease the sensation of fatigue.

   * Examples of well known stimulants include [caffeine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine), [cocaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine), [amphetamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine), [modafinil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modafinil), and [ephedrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephedrine). Caffeine, although a stimulant, has not been banned by the International Olympic Committee or the World Anti Doping Agency since 2004. It has a positive effect on various physical parameters, most of all endurance, but also on velocity, strength, reaction time and specific actions like throwing performance. 
   * Other ways of cheating that change the body without using foreign substances include injecting one’s own red blood cells as done with [doping at the Tour de France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_at_the_Tour_de_France), treating blood with UV light or the use of a hyperbaric chamber (not currently banned), and, potentially, [gene doping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_doping).
   *  **Anabolic steroids.** 

     * Anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) are now used therapeutically in medicine to induce bone growth, stimulate appetite, induce male puberty, and treat chronic wasting conditions, such as cancer and AIDS. Anabolic steroids also increase muscle mass and physical strength, and are therefore used in sports and bodybuilding to enhance strength or physique. Known side effects include harmful changes in [cholesterol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol) levels (increased [low-density lipoprotein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein) and decreased [high-density lipoprotein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein)), [acne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acne_vulgaris), [high blood pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_blood_pressure), and [liver damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity). Some of these effects can be mitigated by taking supplemental drugs.
     * A number of studies measuring anabolic steroid use in high school athletes found that out of all 12th grade students, 6.6 percent of them had used anabolic steroids at some point in their high school careers or were approached and counseled to use them. Of those students who acknowledged doping with anabolic–androgenic steroids, well over half participated in school-sponsored athletics, including football, wrestling, track and field, and baseball. A second study showed 6.3 percent of high school student Football players admitted to current or former AAS use. At the collegiate level, surveys show that AAS use among athletes range from 5 percent to 20 percent and continues to rise. The study found that skin changes were an early marker of steroid use in young athletes, and underscored the important role that dermatologists could play in the early detection and intervention in these athletes.
   * **Stimulants**

     * Stimulants are drugs that usually act on the central nervous system to modulate mental function and behavior, increasing an individual's sense of excitement and decreasing the sensation of fatigue. In the World Anti-Doping Agency list of prohibited substances, stimulants are the second largest class after the anabolic steroids.
