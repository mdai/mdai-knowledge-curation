# First-Line Systemic therapy


## 1. First choice first-line therapy 



* The IMbrave 150 trial met both co-primary endpoints and demonstrated that the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab is superior to sorafenib in terms of overall survival (HR 0.58; 95% CI, 0.47-0.76) and progression free survival (0.59; 95% CI, 0.42–0.79) (1) 
* The combination was also associated with a higher response rate, duration of response and longer duration to reduced QOL
* Because of the increased risk of variceal haemorrhage with bevacizumab, gastroscopic assessment and treatment of varices within six months of therapy is recommended in those at risk. 


## 2. Alternative first-line therapy



* In patients for whom atezolizumab or bevacizumab are contraindicated or not acceptable to patient, sorafenib(2, 3) and lenvatinib are alternative options
* The REFLECT trial met its primary endpoint and demonstrated that lenvatinib was non-inferior to sorafenib in terms of overall (HR 0.92; 95% CI, 0·79–1·06)(4) 
* In considering the option of lenvatinib or sorafenib, the following should be taken into account
    * Lenvatinib is associated with a superior PFS, TTP, ORR and disease control rate compared with sorafenib 
    * Patients with Vp4 were and ≥ 50% liver involvement were excluded from REFLECT trial 
    * There is no evidence-based second-line therapy after lenvatinib 
    * Regorafenib, cabozantinib and ramucirumab have level 1A evidence as second line therapy after sorafenib
    * Hypertension, weight loss, proteinuria, hypothyroidism and vomiting are more common with lenvatinib
    * PPE, diarrhoea, alopecia and rash are more common with sorafenib

# Second-Line Systemic Therapy


## 1. After Atezolizumab and Bevacizumab



* There is no evidence-based standard of care after Atezo/Bev
* Progressive disease was the best response in 20% patients treated with Atezo/Bev and the median PFS was 6.8 months. There is therefore a significant need for second line therapy in this setting(1) 
* In the IMbrave 150 trial 63 (19%) patients received a TKI post Atezo/Bev but no data on outcome published to date
* Patients who are fit (PS &lt;2 and Child-Pugh A) may benefit from a multi-kinase inhibitor and should ideally be offered this in the context of a randomised trial
* There is no data to support one TKI over another and sorafenib, lenvatinib and cabozantinib may be considered 
* The rational for ramucirumab in patients progressing on bevacizumab is weaker than that for a TKI
* Regorafenib is not appropriate in patients who have not had sorafenib but may be considered third line after sorafenib


## 2. After Sorafenib



* Placebo controlled randomised trials support the use of regorafenib(2) in those that tolerated sorafenib, ramucirumab(3) in those with AFP ≥400 ng/mL and cabozantinib(4). HR for OS were 0.63, 0.71 and 0.76 respectively. In the CELESTIAL trial, 27% received cabozantinib as 3rd line therapy and for those that received cabozantinib as second line therapy, the HR was 0.70
* There are no predictive biomarkers to inform decision making in this setting and cross-trial comparisons are not robust in terms of differentiating toxicity or secondary outcomes
* The FDA granted conditional approval for nivolumab and pembrolizumab as second line therapy after sorafenib. These approvals were based on single arm phase II trials (5, 6) but the phase III trial of nivolumab in the first-line failed to meet its primary endpoint (7)and the phase III trial of pembrolizumab in the second line also failed to meet its endpoint(8). Therefore these options are not generally recommended. 
* The FDA also granted conditional approval for the combination of nivolumab 1mg/kg and ipilimumab 3mg/kg both three weekly for three cycles followed by single agent nivolumab 240mg 2 weekly. This was based on date from 49 patients treated in the CheckMate 040 trial (9) where response rate of 33% was reported. The phase three trial of this combination is ongoing and, in the absence of data from this trial, the combination is not generally recommended. 


## 3. After Lenvatinib 



* There is no evidence based standard of care following lenvatinib
* In the REFLECT trial 156 patients (33%) received post-study medication and of these, 121 (25%) received sorafenib. The outcome of these patients has not been reported to date. 
* The benefit and toxicity second line therapy is not known and patients should ideally be treated in the context of clinical trials

# Hepatitis B virus and systemic therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma 


## Introduction

Chronic HBV infection is featured by the persistence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity for more than 6 months, and this poses a strong risk of developing cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).1 Globally, chronic HBV infection accounts for more than half of HCC, and frequently complicates the management of HCC during systemic therapy.2 The impact of HBV on the management of HCC and related guidance on management of HBV is discussed below:


## Management of HBV during systemic therapy for HCC

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Screening and monitoring</span> 

All patients with the diagnosis of HCC should be tested for HBsAg prior to commencement of systemic therapy.3,4 For patients who are positive for HBsAg, HBV DNA should be determined at baseline and monitored every 1-3 months during systemic therapy.3 Liver biochemistry, particularly alanine aminotransferase (ALT), should also be monitored at least every 4-6 weeks along the course of systemic therapy. For patients who are negative for HBsAg, hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) may be tested according to local practice to identify patients with prior HBV exposure. In case of HBsAg-negative and anti-HBc-positive, patients should be monitored with ALT, HBV DNA and HBsAg regularly.3 The above monitoring measures should be continued for at least 12 months after cessation of systemic therapy or until clinically not indicated (e.g. terminal stage of HCC).3 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Prevention of HBV reactivation</span>

HBV reactivation refers to loss of immune control of HBV in patients with chronic HBV infection or prior exposure to HBV after immunosuppressive treatment. The reactivation of HBV activity is followed by hepatitis flare which is reflected by an elevation of ALT. Heterogeneous definitions of HBV reactivation and hepatitis flare have been described in literatures. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases provides a detailed and updated definition:3 In HBsAg-positive, anti-HBc-positive patients, HBV reaction is defined: 1) ≥2 log (100-fold) increase in HBV DNA compared to the baseline; or 2) HBV DNA ≥3 log (1,000) IU/mL in a patient with previously undetectable HBV level; or 3) HBV DNA ≥4 log (10,000) IU/mL if the baseline value is not available. For patients who are HbsAg-negative, Anti-HBc-positive, the definition of HBV reactivation is: 1) HBV DNA is detectable; or 2) reappearance of HBsAg. A hepatitis flare is defined as an ALT rise to ≥ 3 times of baseline level and > 100 U/L. 

	In the old era of cytotoxic chemotherapy, HBV reactivation occurred in up to 40% of HCC patients without antiviral therapy. However, HBV reactivation is less commonly encountered in the modern era of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), likely due to less immunosuppressive property of approved TKIs for HCC5 and common use of antiviral therapy for HBV in patients with HCC.6 Regarding immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), initial experiences came from clinical trials whereas all patients with HBsAg positivity are required to have extremely low HBV viral load (&lt;100 IU/ml) and prophylactic antiviral therapy prior to recruitment.7-9 Under these circumstances, although fluctuation of HBV viral load has been observed during the treatment, significant HBV reactivation and/or hepatitis is rarely observed.10 For HBsAg-positive patients, antiviral therapy is essential during ICIs because multiple case series showed that HBV reactivation could occur when antiviral therapy was not administered. 11-13 In the real-world setting, it is less clear whether HBV reactivation remains uncommon in patients with higher baseline HBV viral load and higher tumour burden. Further, hepatic events, including the elevation of ALT, frequently occur during ICIs treatment,14 and HBV reactivation should always be an important differential diagnosis during work-up.15

	The detailed HBV prophylaxis treatment has been described in various guidelines.3,4 For HBsAg-positive patients, if antiviral therapy is not commenced prior to diagnosis of HCC, prophylactic antiviral should be commenced at least 7 days prior to systemic therapy. Either entecavir or tenofovir is preferred because of higher potency and resistance barriers compared to other nucleos(t)ide analogues.16,17 Currently, there is no consensus on the optimal timing of stopping anti-HBV prophylaxis after completion of anticancer treatment for HCC. For general cancers, it was recommended that prophylaxis should be continued for at least 6 months after completion of immunosuppressive therapy.3 For HCC, most patients have comorbid significant liver fibrosis and/or cirrhosis, which is an indication for long-term antiviral therapy.18 Also, most patients require multiple lines of systemic therapy with short drug-free interval, hence it is reasonable for clinicians to continue antiviral therapy without interruption in the remaining course of advanced disease. 


## HBV as a predictor of efficacy of systemic therapy

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Targeted therapy </span>

Understanding on the influence of HBV on outcomes of systemic therapy mainly comes from subgroup analyses of prospective clinical trials. For sorafenib, according to subgroup analyses of both SHARP and the AP-SHARP studies, the survival benefits of sorafenib were less noticeable in subpopulations of HBV infection as the aetiology of HCC.19,20 These observations were further confirmed by an individual patient meta-analysis on three other phase III clinical trials comparing sorafenib to competitor small molecules, namely linifanib, sunitinib and brivanib.21 A total of 3256 patients, with 50% receiving first-line sorafenib, were analysed, and it was found that survival benefits of sorafenib were demonstrated in the HBV-negative/HCV-positive subgroup but not in the HBV-positive/HCV-negative subgroup, as compared to other TKIs.21 The above findings were not observed with other targeted agents. For lenvatinib, as shown by the REFLECT study, survival benefits were similarly observed in HCC of HBV or HCV aetiology.22 For cabozantinib, pre-planned subgroup analyses of the CELESTIAL study in sorafenib-treated population showed that the HBV subgroup tended to benefit more from the drug than the HCV subgroup.23 For regorafenib, the RESORCE study showed that survival benefits persisted regardless of the presence of hepatitis B status or not.24 For ramucirumab, REACH2 study indicated that survival benefits were observed in HCC of all aetiologies, including HBV.25 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Immune check-point inhibitors </span>

	The influence of viral aetiology on the outcomes of ICIs is less understood. The Checkmate 459 study suggested that HCC of HBV or HCV aetiology had trends of more OS benefits from nivolumab than the patients with non-B-non-C aetiology.26 For pembrolizumab, subgroup analyses of the Keynote 240 clinical trial showed that pembrolizumab benefitted HCC of all aetiologies in terms of OS, but there was a trend of more benefits in the HBV subgroup than the HCV and non-B-non-C aetiology.8 In the IMBRAVE150 study, the regimen of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab benefitted patients of all aetiologies but there was a trend of more benefit in the HBV or HCVsubgroup than the non-B-non-C subgroup.27 

	In summary, the findings on the impact of HBV on outcomes of sorafenib are supported by two phase III clinical trials and meta-analyses on another three phase III clinical trials. Therefore, the aetiology of HCC should be one of the considerations for clinicians planning to administer sorafenib for patients. For other targeted agents and ICIs, the association of viral aetiology with treatment outcomes is less clear. Caution should be exercised when interpreting subgroup analyses of single clinical trials, which are prone to bias. 


## Areas of research on HBV in ICI treatment 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Optimal baseline HBV NDA</span>

The optimal cut-off HBV DNA for enrolment to clinical trials on ICIs is unknown. Currently, most sponsored clinical trials have adopted a conservative approach of using undetectable or extremely low HBV DNA cut-off ranging from 100 to 500 IU/ml as inclusion criteria. According to one retrospective study on 6 out 141 patients who developed HBV reactivation during ICIs for treatment of various cancer types, multivariate analysis showed that the prophylactic antiviral therapy, but not baseline HBV DNA level, to be the single independent predictor for HBV reactivation.11 This study gives a clue that baseline HBV viral load may be less crucial than prophylactic antiviral therapy on the development of HBV reactivation during ICI treatment. However, more robust data are required to determine the optimal cut-off of HBV viral load prior to commencement of ICIs. 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Population of HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc-positive</span>

In general, patients who are HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc-positive have a lower risk of HBV reactivation than HBsAg-positive counterparts. For HCC, most clinicians prefer monitoring instead of prophylactic antiviral treatment in this population. However, HBV reactivation may still occur in this population who undergo biologics with immunomodulatory effects (e.g. rituximab, infliximab) for other diseases,28,29 or undergo ICIs in the presence of human immunodeficiency viruses infection.30 When ICI use becomes more popular with more novel immunotherapeutic agents in future, safety data of immunotherapy in HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc-positive will be important.
