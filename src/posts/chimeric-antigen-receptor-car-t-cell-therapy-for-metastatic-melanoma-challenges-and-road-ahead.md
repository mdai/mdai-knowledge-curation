Melanoma is the most lethal type of skin cancer \[1–3], which develops from uncontrolled proliferation of the melanin producing cells within the skin, called melanocytes \[1,4]. Patients with melanoma are staged based on the 2009 American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system \[5]. Based on location of the primary tumor, tumor size, number of tumors, lymph node involvement, and the presence or absence of metastasis, melanoma is classified into four stages \[6]. According to the melanoma staging systems, patients with stage IV melanoma show tumor spread throughout the body, called metastatic melanoma \[6–9]. Strategies for treatment of metastatic melanoma include: chemotherapy, radiation, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy \[6,10,11]. Because of their non-specificity and treatment resistance, chemotherapy and radiation therapy are not considered to be good options for the treatment of metastatic melanoma \[6]. New pharmaceutical agents, including anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade immunotherapy, and B-RAF inhibitor targeted therapy have both been approved for metastatic melanoma. However, B-RAF inhibitors lead to treatment resistance, while checkpoint blockades can cause autoimmune disease.

Thus, researchers are still seeking new treatments for metastatic melanoma. Recently, adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) has been investigated as a new strategy for improving the treatment of metastatic melanoma \[11]. CAR T cells kill tumor cells through recognition of target antigens on the surface of tumor cells in a non-MHC restricted manner. Upon antigen recognition, CAR T cells release various cytotoxic molecules such as granzyme and perforin as well as cytokines, leading to tumor cell apoptosis and lysis \[15]. CAR-T cells are genetically modified T lymphocytes that express chimeric antigen receptors, with three main regions: extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular domains \[16]. The extracellular domain contains the scFv (single chain variable fragment) of an antibody that targets a tumor antigen in a non-MHC restricted manner. The scFv domain is linked to the intracellular domain CD3z with or without additional co-stimulatory domains in the intracellular region by the transmembrane region to trigger T lymphocyte activation \[16]. Based on the number of intracellular domains and inclusion of additional genes to CAR transgene, CAR T cells have been classified into five generations. First generation of CAR consists of CD3ζ molecules. Second generation CAR includes CD3ζ and one co-stimulatory molecule (e.g., CD28 or 4-1BB) while third generation CAR consists of CD3ζ and two costimulatory molecules (e.g., CD28 and 4-1BB or OX-40 and CD28). The fourth generation of CAR is designed based on second generation CAR paired with an inducible or constitutively expressed cytokine or chemokine (e.g., IL-12). The fifth generation of CAR is also based on second generation CARs coupled with truncated cytoplasmic domain of particular cytokine receptors with a binding site for specific transcription factors such as STAT3/5. \[17,18]. CAR T cell therapy has been shown to be a potent immunotherapeutic approach for the treatment of hematologic malignancies, and two types of CAR T cells have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of B-cell malignancies \[19]. Nevertheless, there remain challenges, such as selecting the proper target antigen, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and barriers preventing the infiltration of CAR T cells into the tumor microenvironment, which lower the efficacy against solid tumors \[20]. In this present paper, we review the mechanisms of melanoma metastasis to find suitable antigen targets, summarize the preclinical and clinical studies of CAR T cell therapy in metastatic melanoma, together with the advantages and disadvantages, and provide some suggestions to increase treatment efficiency against metastatic melanoma. 2. Mechanisms of Melanoma Metastasis: Implications for CAR T Cell Therapy Although regional lymph node involvement (stage III) is a part of the metastasis process, according to the staging system, only stage IV in which tumor cells metastasize to distant organs is considered as metastatic melanoma \[21]. Melanoma cells mostly metastasize through the lymphatic route \[21], but the hematogenous route also seems to be involved in some cases \[22]. Herein, we will not only review the mechanisms of metastasis that lead to lymph node involvement, hematogenous spread, and the involvement of distant organs (Figure 1), but also how selection of an ideal antigen which has a high surface expression level on cancerous tissues and low surface expression level on normal tissues is critical and could significantly decrease the risk of CAR T cell mediated off-tumor toxicity \[23]. However, the complete mechanisms of melanoma metastasis are not yet fully understood \[21]. 2.1. Angiogenesis Angiogenesis describes the process by which new blood vessels are formed from pre-existing blood vessels, and is one of the most important factors involved in tumor progression and metastasis \[24,25]. Several agents in the TME can stimulate angiogenesis through different mechanisms \[21]. One of the most important causes of angiogenesis is the family of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) \[26]. VEGF-A as a member of the VEGFs family is largely linked to angiogenesis \[27], and its expression level is upregulated in melanoma cells in a hypoxia condition \[27]. Data has been shown that VEGF-A

may be involved in the progression of metastasis \[28]. VEGF-A alone or VEGF-A/PGF
heterodimer contributes to VEGFR2 activation \[28,29]. In line with this finding, studies have
pointed out that VEGFR2 activation predominantly mediates angiogenesis response \[29].
In addition to VEGFs, other growth factors, cytokines, and integrins, including basic
fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), placental growth factor (PGF), urokinase plasminogen
activator \[30], IL8, αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins, and angiopoietins play important roles in
melanoma angiogenesis \[25]. Melanoma cells secrete other growth factors, including bFGF
(FGF2) and PGFs. bFGF is a potent angiogenic factor that regulates many cellular functions
such as angiogenesis \[31]. It has been shown that the action of matrix metalloproteinase
results in bFGF release, which binds to its receptor on endothelial cells, FGFR1. This
interaction promotes melanoma metastasis by regulating endothelial cell proliferation and
increasing angiogenesis \[32,33].

PGFs (PGF1 and PGF2) interact with VEGFR1 and also with neuropilin-1 and neuropilin2 receptors on endothelial cells. PGFs enhances angiogenesis in two ways: direct effects
on pre-existing endothelial cells, and indirect effects, by recruitment of VEGFR-1 positive
hematopoietic precursor cells from the bone marrow to blood vessels \[34,35].
Urokinase plasminogen activator, which binds to the uPAR receptor, plays a role in
melanoma progression and metastasis \[36]. uPAR is expressed on both endothelial and
melanoma tumor cells \[25]. uPAR regulates angiogenesis by increasing endothelial cell
migration and organization into tube-like structures \[37].
IL-8 is another molecule with a significant role in angiogenesis. IL-8 binds to Gprotein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), including CXCR1 and CXCR2 on endothelial cells, and
induces endothelial cell migration and permeability. Experimental studies have shown
that IL-8 over-expression could increase angiogenesis and melanoma metastasis \[38,39].
Studies have also shown that lymphangiogenesis plays an important role in the spread
of melanoma to regional lymph nodes, and in metastasis \[40].
VEGF-C secreted from melanoma cells can bind to VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 on lymphatic
endothelial cells \[41] and promote formation of lymphatic vessels and increase lymph node
metastasis \[42,43]. In 2008, Sini and colleagues have reported that inhibition of VEGFRs
reduced lymph node metastasis in an animal model of metastatic melanoma \[44].
In addition to cellular adhesion, invasion and migration, αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins expressed on endothelial cells can regulate angiogenesis by modulating VEGF and bFGF \[30,45].
These pathways play a crucial role in the progression of localized melanoma to metastatic
melanoma \[46].
2.2. Extravasation and Intravasation
Intravasation is the process by which a single or a group of melanoma cells, which have
become detached from the primary tumor, can enter the blood or lymphatic vasculature
system \[47]. After intravasation, tumor cells move out of the vessels into the surrounding
tissues (extravasation) \[48]. In these steps, the melanoma cells require adhesion molecules
to stick to the endothelial cells, and proteolytic enzymes to invade into the extracellular
matrix (ECM) \[21,47].
Adhesion molecules include cadherins, integrins, and the immunoglobulin superfamily. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) also play an important role in intravasation and
extravasation, which are two important steps in melanoma metastasis \[47].
2.2.1. Cadherins
Melanoma cells undergo loss of expression of E (epithelial)-cadherin, and at the same
time gain expression of N (neural) cadherin. N-cadherin is a classical cadherin which
leads to adhesion of melanoma cells to each other, and to other N-cadherin expressing cells
such as endothelial cells \[47]. An in vivo study in immunocompromised mice showed that
silencing of N-cadherin inhibited melanoma cell extravasation and lung metastasis \[49].
Therefore, this membrane protein may be a potential target for CAR T cell therapy for
metastatic melanoma.
2.2.2. Integrins
Integrins are a family of adhesion molecules that contribute to angiogenesis, tumor
cell proliferation, migration and metastasis, by cell–cell or cell–matrix interactions \[50].
Expression of integrin αvβ3 on melanoma cells led to increased metastasis to the lungs \[51].
Melanoma cells that express integrin α4β1 tend towards lymph node metastasis \[52]
through binding to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) on endothelial cells \[53].
Integrin α4β1 also facilitated migration of CCR9 bearing melanocytes to the small intestine \[54]. As melanoma cells do not express B2-integrins (LFA-1 or Mac-1) on their
surface, these cells can bind to the B2-integrins of neutrophils by their intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1), and then move into the vessels \[48]. During angiogenesis, the
endothelial cells over-express αv-integrins that can bind to lactadherin (also known as

milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 protein) on melanoma cells, thus increasing adhesion and
migration \[55]. The α6β4 integrin on melanoma tumor cells is able to interact with lung
endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (Lu-ECAM or CLCA2), that is expressed on lung
cells and can lead to lung metastasis \[56]. Because of the role of integrins in angiogenesis,
tumor growth, and metastasis, several integrin inhibitors are under investigation in clinical
trials \[57]. Most of the clinical trials are studying αvβ3 integrin inhibitors \[58].
2.2.3. Immunoglobulin Superfamily (IgSF)
Several members of the IgSF, including MCAM (CD146), NCAM (CD56), ALCAM
(CD166), and L1-CAM (CD171) have been associated with metastasis in several cancers
such as melanoma \[59]. The melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM/MUC18), also
known as CD146, is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, and a cell adhesion
molecule that mediates adhesion between melanoma cells themselves, as well as adhesion
between melanoma cells and endothelial cells \[60]. An in vivo study showed that an
anti-MCAM/MUC18 antibody inhibited melanoma growth and metastasis \[61]. Activated
leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM), CD166, or MEMD is a type I membrane
protein and another member of the IgSF. Over-expression of ALCAM increased melanoma
cell aggregation and metastasis \[62–64]. Studies have shown that blocking of ALCAM by
the secreted variant of ALCAM diminished metastatic capacity in nude mice \[65]. The
interaction between NCAM and CD56, that mediates cell–cell adhesion, is expressed on
several tumor types such as melanoma, where it increases metastasis \[66]. An in vivo study
demonstrated that the silencing of NCAM expression inhibited melanoma cell invasion and
metastasis \[67]. L1-CAM is another cell adhesion molecule, and its over-expression was
associated with melanoma metastasis \[68]. L1-CAM knock-down reduced metastasis in a
melanoma xenograft model \[69]. Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1)
or CD31 is another member of the IgSF that is expressed on endothelial cells. Melanoma
cells which over-express heparan sulfates can interact with endothelial cells by binding to
PECAM-1 \[70]. It was shown that the heparan sulfate-PECAM-1 interaction contributed to
tumor cell arrest and extravasation \[59]. An in vivo study showed that an anti-PECAM-1
mAb inhibited metastasis in melanoma \[71], and could be a potential target for CAR T cell
therapy in metastatic melanoma.
Platelet factor 4 (PF4) or CXCL4 is a protein that can inhibit tumor metastasis by
decreasing blood vessel integrity, angiogenesis inhibition, increasing myeloid-derived
suppressor cells (MDSCs), and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) \[72,73]. As such, based
on studies \[74], the PF4/CXCL4 recombinant protein could be a therapeutic option in
combination with CAR T cell therapy for metastatic melanoma by preventing angiogenesis.
2.2.4. Matrix Metalloproteinases
MMPs are endopeptidase enzymes \[75] that degrade and remodel the extracellular
matrix (ECM) via proteolytic activity, and are involved in invasion and metastasis \[76].
Members of this family include both soluble and membrane-bound types \[77]. Although
the soluble forms of MMPs may not be a direct target for CAR T cell therapy, they can
be used indirectly in combination with CAR T cell therapy against other targets. Thus in
this section, we will cover both soluble and membrane bound MMPs. Over-expression of
MMP-1, 2, 9, 13 and 14 was shown to occur in invasive melanoma \[76]. Studies have shown
that inhibition of MMP-1 decreases melanoma metastasis in nude mice \[78], whereas forced
over-expression of MMP-1 in non-invasive melanoma cells induced a metastatic phenotype \[79]. Moreover, the role of MMP-2 in human melanoma invasion and metastasis is also
important \[80]. Membrane type-1 MMP (MT1-MMP) (or MMP-14) is a cell–surface membrane protein, which activates MMP-2 leading to matrix degradation and melanoma cell
invasion and metastasis \[81]. MT1-MMP can also degrade ECM directly by cleavage of ECM
components, such as collagens, laminin, and fibrins \[77]. The expression of MT1-MMP on
endothelial cells contributes to angiogenesis by ECM remodeling and promotion of vessel
growth \[82]. Active MMP-2 can either be membrane-bound or secreted \[76]. The secretedform can bind to integrin αvβ3 and facilitate matrix degradation and melanoma cell migration \[83]. The cell-surface hyaluronan receptor, CD44, binds to MMP9 on melanoma cells
and forms a CD44/MMP9 complex. It has been shown that disruption of the CD44/MMP9
complex inhibits tumor invasion \[84]. Based on an in vivo study, stromal derived MMP-13
(a collagenolytic enzyme) is also required for melanoma metastasis \[85]. However, MMP8 (a collagenase II enzyme) has anti-tumor and anti-metastatic activity in cancers such
as melanoma. Therefore, CAR T cells that additionally express MMP-8 may be a good
combination therapy for treatment of metastatic melanoma \[86].
2.3. Leukocyte-Cancer Cell Fusion Hypothesis
In 1992, John Pawelek, discovered metastatic melanoma cells that resembled fused
macrophage-melanoma hybrid cells \[87]. In vitro studies have shown that melanomamacrophage hybrids showed markedly higher tumorigenicity and metastatic capacity \[88,89].
Macrophage and cancer cell fusion results in epigenetic reprogramming. The metastatic hybrid cells increase the expression of macrophage markers, including SPARC, SNAIL, MET,
MITF, CD14, CD68, CD163, CD204 and CD206. They also express integrin subunits including α3, α5, α6, αv, β1, β3; GnT-V (β1,6-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-V) and its enzymatic
products, β1,6-branched oligosaccharides and cell-surface LAMP1. These molecules lead
to increased tumorigenicity and metastatic potential in these melanoma hybrid cells \[90,91].
The hybrid cells also express melanocyte markers (ALCAM, MLANA), and stem cell markers (CD44, CXCR4) \[91]. The glycan molecules, β1,6-branched oligosaccharides, contribute
to motility, invasion and metastasis of melanoma by influencing the adhesion to extracellular matrix components \[92,93]. Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC)
or osteonectin is a extracellular protein \[94] that increases tumor metastasis by driving
vascular permeability and extravasation \[95]. Snail is a transcription factor that induces
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT- EMT is a crucial characteristic of invading cancer
cells) by suppressing the expression of E-cadherin \[96,97]. MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase
and membrane-bound protein that binds to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). In vivo studies have indicated that over-expression of either MET or HGF promotes metastasis \[98,99].
Moreover, MET inhibitors have been shown to inhibit metastasis in both melanoma animal
models and in patients \[100–102]. Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF)
is a transcription factor that is required for metastasis in melanoma animal models, and
its depletion from melanoma cells decreased lung metastasis \[103]. Lysosome-associated
membrane protein-1 (LAMP1), also known CD107a, is a surface protein that is expressed
on melanoma-macrophage hybrid cells and increases their invasion and metastatic potential \[104]. Binding of this molecule to galectin-3 in the lungs is one mechanism that
can lead to metastasis \[105]. LAMP1 interaction with the ECM in target organs could be
another mechanism \[106]. Also, LAMP1 is a major carrier of β1,6 branched N-glycans \[107].
Down-regulation of LAMP1 significantly reduced the metastatic capacity of melanoma
cells \[108]. GnT-V is a Golgi membrane-bound protein that catalyzes the formation of 1,6 Nacetylglucosamine in the Golgi apparatus and its down-regulation inhibited metastasis in
gastric cancer cells \[109]. Therefore, targeting GnT-V, SPARC, SNAIL, MITF in combination
with CAR T cells that are specific to surface proteins of MTFs (macrophage-tumor fusion
cells), such as β1,6-branched oligosaccharides, MET and LAMP1 may improve CAR T
cell performance in metastatic melanoma by eliminating leukocyte-cancer fusion cells.
Since CD14 and CD68 are pan-macrophage markers \[91], it would be risky to target them,
but CD163, CD204 and CD206 are mainly expressed by M2 macrophages, which are the
tumor-promoting phenotypes \[91]. Therefore, targeting M2 markers may be a good idea
for elimination of melanoma-macrophage hybrid cells. MLANA/MART-1 is a melanocyte
specific marker that is recognized by T cells. One clinical trial investigated adoptive transfer of MART-1 specific TCR engineered T cells in metastatic melanoma patients. Their
results showed potent evidence of tumor regression \[110]. Although antibodies against
this marker are used for the diagnosis of melanoma \[111], this target has not been used for
MAb therapy. CD44 is the receptor for hyaluronic acid and a transmembrane glycoprotein
Cells 2021, 10, 1450 7 of 29
that is expressed on cancer stem cells \[112]. Among CD44 variants, the CD44v3 splice is
associated with metastasis in melanoma patients \[113]. The targeting of CD44 variants
with MAbs could be a novel immunotherapy for cancer treatment \[114], and CD44v3 may
be a potential target for CAR T cell therapy for metastatic melanoma. CXCR4 activation on
tumor cells is associated with increased metastasis in several cancers by promoting invasion, tumor cell proliferation, matrix degradation, and neoangiogenesis \[115]. Interestingly,
CXCR4 is widely expressed on both T cells and hematopoietic stem cells \[116]. It is possible
to design anti-CXCR4 CAR T cells by inserting a CAR construct into the endogenous locus
of CXCR4 in T cells using a Crispr/CAS9 approach \[117]. However, the use of this molecule
as a CAR T target should be further investigated due to its expression on hematopoietic
stem cells.
2.4. Embolisms
The formation of a tumor cell embolism appears to contribute to hematogenous
metastasis. In the emboli, tumor cells form aggregates with leukocytes and platelets \[22].
Moreover, prothrombotic agents such as protease-activated thrombin receptor (PAR-1),
thrombin, and platelet-specific receptor glycoprotein Ib-IX (gpIb-IX) play a role in embolism formation and melanoma metastasis \[118,119]. PAR-1 is a seven transmembrane
G-protein-coupled receptor that is expressed on metastatic melanoma cells and activated
by proteolytic cleavage of the N-terminal domain of the receptor by serine proteases (especially thrombin) \[120]. MMP-1 is also involved in PAR1 activation \[121]. Maspin is a
tumor suppressor protein that is negatively regulated via PAR-1 in metastatic melanoma.
Maspin decreased lung metastasis in melanoma by inhibiting MMP-2 expression and
activity \[120]. Also, PAR-1 increases expression of connexin-43 in gap junctions, which
is critical for tumor cell extravasation in metastatic melanoma \[122]. PAR-1 activation
increased expression of platelet activating factor receptor (PAFR) and its ligand (PAF). The
PAFR/PAF complex can activate platelets and promote tumor-platelet aggregation \[123].
Therefore, PAR-1 targeting could be a monotherapy or a combination approach with CAR
T cell therapy for treatment of metastatic melanoma \[120]. TR47 is a soluble peptide that
is generated upon cleavage of PAR-1, and decreased melanoma metastasis in vivo \[124].
Therefore, CAR T cells that express TR47 may be a good choice for treatment of metastatic
melanoma. Platelet-specific receptor gpIb-IX is a major adhesion protein that is expressed
on platelet membranes, and is activated after interaction with different ligands, such as
von Willebrand factor (vWF), to form platelet aggregates \[125]. Tumor cells express adhesion molecules, such as P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) and CD44, which
bind to P-selectin on activated platelets to form aggregates \[126]. Activated platelets in
the thrombus protect circulating tumor cells from the cytolytic activity of NK cells by
formation of platelet-tumor cell aggregates, and enable melanoma cells to extravasate from
the circulation and metastasize to the lungs \[119,127]. Although these glycoproteins play
a major role in platelet aggregation, it is possible that targeting this receptor may cause
platelet disorders including thrombocytopenia.
2.5. Cancer Stem Cells
In several solid tumors including metastatic melanoma, cancer stem cells (CSCs) are
responsible for resistance to conventional treatment, recurrence, and progression of tumors.
In metastatic melanoma CSCs are also known as malignant melanoma stem cells \[128].
These cells contribute to melanoma metastasis by promoting neovascularization, angiogenesis, matrix degradation, intravasation, and extravasation. Melanoma stem cells can differentiate into endothelial-like cells and promote neovascularization. They can also lead to
angiogenesis by expression of VEGFs. Growth factors and cytokines in the tumor microenvironment can affect melanoma stem cells, and reprogram the expression of transcription
factors that are involved in EMT. These cells can degrade the matrix by MMPs, and destroy
the endothelial barrier, resulting in intravasation and extravasation. Therefore, melanoma
stem cells ultimately promote invasion and metastasis \[129]. Melanoma stem cells express
Cells 2021, 10, 1450 8 of 29
specific markers, including CD133, CD20, ABCB5, CD271, and ALDH1 \[129]. Studies have
shown that targeting of melanoma stem cells using CD133 and CD20 specific monoclonal
antibodies attenuated tumor growth and lowered the metastatic potential \[130,131]. ABCB5
promotes metastasis by activation of the NF-κB pathway, so this marker could provide
a potential therapeutic target \[132]. Immunotherapy by administering a CD271 specific
antibody effectively suppressed metastasis in a melanoma animal model \[133]. Targeting
of ALDH1 (aldehyde dehydrogenase) reduced metastasis in melanoma \[134]. As such, it
appears that these markers may be good targets for CAR T cell therapy. Other candidate
markers, including CD166, CXCR4, or neural precursor cell expressed developmentally
down-regulated protein 9 (NEDD9), might also be involved in MMSC invasion, migration,
and metastasis \[128], but further studies are need to confirm their involvement. Other markers such as jumonju AT-rich interactive domain 1B (JARID1B) are expressed on melanoma
stem cells \[129], but have not been correlated with melanoma invasion or metastasis \[135].
2.6. Chemotactic Molecules
Chemokines and chemoattractant cytokines bind to their receptors, and play a key role
in the metastatic process in several cancers, including melanoma \[136]. Takeuchi, in 2004,
showed that expression of the CCR7 chemokine receptor on melanoma cells increased the
migration of these cells to lymph nodes by binding to the CCL21 chemokine \[137]. However,
since CCR7 is also expressed on naïve T cells and dendritic cells \[138], it is possible that
targeting of this receptor, although it could decrease metastasis, could also disrupt the
migration of normal immune cells to the lymph nodes and inhibit the anti-tumor response.
Therefore, this receptor is not thought to be a specific target for melanoma immunotherapy
using CAR T cells. Preclinical studies have shown that CXCR3 expression on melanoma
cells increases metastasis to lymph nodes, and that inhibition of CXCR3 by antisense RNA
decreased lymph node metastasis \[139]. IGF-1R and CXCR4 showed higher expression
on uveal melanoma cells compared to normal melanocytes. Therefore, because of the
high expression of the corresponding ligands (IGF and CXCL12, respectively) in the liver,
uveal melanoma most often shows liver metastasis \[140,141]. Moreover, CCL25 which is
produced by small intestinal epithelial cells recruits CCR9-expressing melanoma cells \[54].
In conclusion, several MAbs and antagonists have been used to block chemokine receptors in melanoma to inhibit metastasis. Application of CAR T cells to target chemokines
and receptors must be carefully investigated and monitored due to their wide expression,
and their role in recruitment of immune cells to tumor sites. It is possible that SynNotch receptor CAR T cells or tandem CAR T cells could reduce the off-target toxicity of CAR T cells
that recognize chemotactic molecules. Further, using the fourth generation TRUCK (T cells
redirected for antigen-unrestricted cytokine-initiated killing) CAR T cells should be largely
investigated. Despite the benefits of cytokines and chemokines produced by TRUCKs for
CAR T cells function and endogenous immune system activation \[142], it is possible these
cytokines and chemokines facilitate melanoma metastasis in the cancer patients.
Collectively, we discussed the mechanisms involving in melanoma metastasis and
further introduced several target antigens that can be targeted via CAR T cells in melanoma
(Table 1). Still, it should be noted that many other targets are available in this context, but
since they cannot be targeted by CAR T cells, mainly due to lack of surface expression,
we did not fully discuss here. For example, various studies have shown that targeting
pathways involved in melanoma tumor growth and survival including BRAF and MAPK
pathways with specific inhibitors such as vemurafenib and trametinib, respectively, contribute to enhanced overall survival of metastatic melanoma patients \[143,144]. Of note,
acquired resistance and reoccurrence of disease is the main challenge in this type of therapy \[145]. Therefore, we believe that CAR T cells might have an additional advantage
compared to conventional inhibitor therapies and could be used in combination therapeutic
regimens to enhance overall anti-tumor efficacy in the clinical practice. Moreover, combination therapy using CAR T cells and immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., anti-PD-L1) can
also be another appealing therapeutic strategy for patients with metastatic melanoma

In the previous sections we summarized some candidate target antigens in metastatic
melanoma and the metastasis process (Table 1). Here we discuss some preclinical studies and clinical trials that have been carried out (or are in progress) on melanoma and
metastatic melanoma.
3.1. Preclinical Studies
Several pre-clinical studies have laid the foundation for further studies that may
progress to clinical trials. CD16, CD126, CD70, B7-H3, HER2, VEGFR-2, gp100/HLA-A2
complex, CSPG4, GD2, and GD3 have been studied as potential candidate antigens for
CAR T cells (Figure 2) \[147,148,159,161–172]. The details are presented in Table 2, and we
will discuss some of them in detail below.
Figure 2. Schematic overview of target antigens for CAR T cells in the pre-clinical and clinical studies. To date, these antigens
have been considered as potential targets for CAR T cells in pre-clinical studies and in clinical trials in melanoma patients.
CD126 is abnormally expressed in many types of both solid and hematological human tumors. In a dose-dependent manner, CD126-targeted CAR T cells demonstrated
potent anti-tumor function in vitro and strong anti-tumor response in metastatic melanoma
xenograft mouse model \[163].
The chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4) antigen also known as MCSP is
strongly expressed on 90% of melanoma cancer cell lines, and other tumors such as glioblastoma, sarcoma, and leukemia. CSPG4 plays a crucial role in melanoma cell proliferation,
migration, invasion, and metastasis \[173]. A study showed that anti-CSPG4 NKT cells
could be transiently transfected using electroporation, with improved activity, and the
in-vitro functionality after stimulation with melanoma cells was assessed. Compared to
conventional CAR T cells, the anti-CSPG4 NKT cells generated a lower amount of cytokines,
such as IFN-γ and TNF, but could still effectively kill melanoma cells \[174]. In another
study anti-CSPG4 CAR T cells transfected with siPD-1 and siCTLA4 showed reduced
expression of PD-1, and were able to secrete higher quantities of cytokines and a good
cytolytic effect against the A375M melanoma cell line \[174]. In an interesting study, Simon
et al. engineered T cells expressing both anti-CSPG4 CAR and anti-gp100 engineered TCR
at the same time. These cells generated cytokines and carried out cytolytic activity when
encountering their target antigens alone, while no two-sided suppression of the receptors
was observed. However, an improved cytolytic effect was observed after co-culturing with
target cells that expressed both the target antigens \[168]Inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) could theoretically inhibit tumor growth by an anti-angiogenic effect \[148]. Pre-clinical studies targeting
this marker have shown promising results \[147–149]. The above-mentioned studies have
tested different approaches, all with satisfactory results. Chinnasamy et al. utilized CAR
T cells targeting VEGFR-2 plus exogenous IL-2. This approach inhibited the melanoma
tumor, mediated through attacking the vasculature and not the tumor itself, because the
tumor expression of VEGFR-2 was low \[147]. Another study combined TCRs that targeted
melanoma tumor antigens (gp100, TRP-1, and TRP-2) with VEGFR-2 that targeted the
tumor vasculature. They concluded that the simultaneous approach had synergistic effects
on tumor eradication, and increased the infiltration and persistence of adoptively transferred tumor-specific T cells within the tumor microenvironment. No significant morbidity
or mortality were observed in the mice receiving anti-VEGFR-2 CAR T cells, except those
administered with anti-VEGFR-2 CAR T cells and TRP-2 TCR transduced T cells \[149].
Inoo et al. utilized CAR-coding messenger RNA (mRNA) delivered by electroporation to
produce anti-VEGFR-2 CAR T cells. The mRNA approach resulted in an efficacy of 100%
to prepare anti-VEGFR-2 CAR T cells from human or murine CAR T cells for the first few
days, without damaging the human T cell activity and phenotypes \[148].
A recent study from Yang et al. reported tandem CAR T cells that targeted CD70
and B7-H3, and found that the tandem CAR T cells could simultaneously distinguish two
tumor-associated antigens and boost the cytolytic effect against tumor cells, as well as
specifically targeting a single antigen. A melanoma mouse model treated by TanCAR T
cells exhibited a more pronounced reduction in tumor burden, when compared to controls,
and to single CAR (CD70 or B7-H3) groups \[164].
The αvβ3 integrin has been found to be over-expressed on a broad range of cancers
including, melanoma, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancer. CAR T cells that targeted
αvβ3 were able to eradicate the metastatic A375 melanoma cell line in vitro, and boost the
anti-tumor effect in vivo. A single inoculation of anti-αvβ3 CAR T cells in mice was able
to inhibit melanoma growth, and increase the long term survival. In summary, anti-αvβ3
CAR T cells killed αvβ3-positive tumor cells rapidly and specifically, secreted IL-2 and
IFN-γ, and themselves underwent effective proliferation \[152].
Overall, the studies discussed above mostly report satisfactory results of various
CAR T cell targeting antigens against metastatic melanoma. Another review on this topic
also discussed the future promise of several molecular targets for CAR T cell therapy in
melanoma, including CSPG4, GD2, CD70, CD20, gp100, and NY-ESO-1 \[175]. Nevertheless,
achieving this goal requires continuing efforts of researchers to overcome these barriers,
and to design the most efficient CAR T cells for future clinical studies.
3.2. Clinical Studies
Owing to the demonstrated success of CAR T cell therapy for melanoma in preclinical
studies, researchers are conducting clinical trials to assess the effectiveness and safety of
this treatment approach in patients. We identified ten clinical trials involving CAR T cell
therapy in patients with melanoma (Table 3). Target tumor antigens included VEGFR2, GD2,
cMet, hCD70, gp100, NY-ESO-1, CD20, IL13R-alpha2, B7H3, and bispecific B7H3xCD19
(Figure 2). All of these trials are phase I or II non-randomized, or single-arm trials, which
will warrant further investigation if successful.
These clinical trials are novel, and many of them are yet to be completed, with the
earliest trial having been started in 2010. Only two studies are completed as of now, and
only one of them has available published data. Six studies are still recruiting patients, and
two others are suspended or have been terminated

The only published results come from a single study conducted on 24 patients, with
a subset of these patients having metastatic melanoma. VEGFR-2 was the target antigen
for the CAR T cells used in this study. Patients received different numbers of CAR T
cells in varying numbers of cycles combined with administration of low or high-dose IL-2.
The study was terminated because of no observed objective response, and 23/24 patients
showing progressive disease. On the other hand, 23/24 patients also suffered from adverse
events, with 5 of them being serious adverse events. Three patients had seriously increased
alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and bilirubin, 2/5 had hypoxia,
and 1 case of serious pain, infection, nausea, and vomiting occurred \[177]. These disappointing results were in contrast with promising results of previous pre-clinical studies
that targeted VEGFR-2 in B16 melanoma bearing mice \[147–149]. One of these animal
studies combined anti-VEGFR-2 CAR T cells with exogenous IL-2, similar to the clinical
trial \[147]. Interestingly, a previous pre-clinical study concluded that co-administration of
anti-VEGFR-2 CAR T cells with TCR transduced cells against tumor antigens (gp100, TRP-1,
and TRP-2) dramatically improved the tumor-free survival compared to anti-VEGFR-2
CAR T cells alone \[149]. Therefore, simultaneous T cell therapies might be more effective
in future clinical trials despite the failure of anti-VEGFR-2 CAR T cells in this clinical trial.
GD-2 was the only antigen targeted in two clinical trials \[2,7], of which one has been
completed, and the results might be published soon. The study added the C7R gene to
the CAR T cells to increase their survival and provide a constant cytokine supply \[7]. One
study tested the anti-GD-2 CAR T cells on blood samples from melanoma patients, and
SK-Mel-28 melanoma cell lines \[176]. CAR T cells produced significant cancer cell killing,
and concurrent PD-1 blockade enhanced their effectiveness. Therefore, we might expect
durable responses from these two clinical trials targeting GD2.
Overall, current evidence from clinical studies is very limited in CAR T cell therapy
for melanoma and metastatic melanoma, and no CAR-based therapy has yet produced
promising results in the clinics. However, the completion of the ongoing clinical trials might
decipher the unknowns in this field and pave the path for possible larger clinical trials.

4. Challenges and Future Directions
   Despite the success of CAR T cells in cancer immunotherapy, several challenges still
   limit the efficacy of CAR T cell therapy in cancers, including antigen selection and off-target
   toxicity, antigen loss and heterogeneity, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and
   insufficient infiltration and penetration of the T cells. Herein, we discuss these challenges
   and propose some solutions in the context of metastatic melanoma (Table 4).
   4.1. Antigen Selection and Off-Target Toxicity
   Several studies have shown that CAR T cell therapy can result in off-target toxicity
   in patients. This arises in patients who express the target antigen in their healthy tissues. Off-target toxicity can be reduced by improving the specific recognition of tumor
   cells and selecting safer target antigens. Melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE) and New
   York esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (NY-ESO1) have been targeted in metastatic
   melanoma, as well as in other cancers \[182–186]. A few studies have reported neurological
   toxicity following MAGE-A3 targeting by TCR engineered T cells \[187]. Moreover, antiVEGFR2 CAR T cells were examined in a clinical trial (NCT01218867) with 24 metastatic
   melanoma patients. The results showed that all patients had disease progression after
   treatment, except one patient who showed a partial response. Therefore, targeting VEGFR2
   seems to be safe in patients, but more research should be performed to improve its effectiveness in the clinic. Another interesting target is CD248. Studies have shown that CD248
   is expressed in 86% of metastatic melanoma specimens using tumor microarrays, with
   no expression in healthy tissues \[188]. It is believed that CD248 is involved in the tumor
   vasculature \[189]. Thus, CD248 could be a useful and safe antigen for CAR T cell therapy
   in metastatic melanoma patients. Despite all the benefits of CAR T cells, safety concerns
   should be considered, especially in high-dose CAR T cell therapies, and CAR T cell ther-
   Cells 2021, 10, 1450 15 of 29
   apies that target the metastasis-associated molecules mentioned in Table 1. Numerous
   approaches have been proposed by several groups to overcome these problems, including
   inhibitory CAR T cells \[190], dual or multivalent antigen recognition domains, with split
   signaling \[191], and insertion of suicide genes \[192]. All these mechanisms could be used
   to reduce the off target toxicity in CAR T cell therapy.
   4.2. Antigen Loss and Heterogeneity
   One of the least investigated challenges in adoptive T cell therapy is tumor antigen
   heterogeneity. It is possible that not all the tumor cells express the target antigen, or if
   they do, the antigen expression is variable. Moreover, immune editing induced by the
   therapy can further lead to immune escape and tumor outgrowth \[193]. Several strategies
   to overcome this hurdle have been proposed, including the bystander killing effect, using
   armored CAR T cells, using dual or multivalent CARs, and administration of drugs to upregulate the target antigens \[149,194–198]. Moreover, many studies have reported antigen
   heterogeneity in metastatic melanoma \[199,200], and have discussed the implications for
   immunotherapy \[201]. Still, no antigen loss or heterogeneity has yet been reported in CAR
   T cell therapy for metastatic melanoma, but this is predicted to occur in the future, after
   wider clinical use of CAR T cells in metastatic melanoma patients. Other strategies can be
   used to overcome antigen heterogeneity and loss in CAR T cell therapy, including using
   epigenetic reversal agents as drugs in combination with CAR T cell therapy. It has been
   shown that histone deacetylase inhibitors or DNA methyltransferase inhibitors can upregulate antigen expression in cancer cells. Kailayangiri et al., showed that pharmacological
   inhibition of Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2 (EZH2 is responsible for repressive
   histone methylation in the genome)), induced surface expression of the GD2 antigen in
   Ewing sarcoma (EwS) cells \[202]. They showed that EZH2 inhibition in EwS cells improved
   anti-GD2 CAR T cell anti-tumor activity. Thus, if antigen loss or heterogeneity was observed
   to present a problem in the application of CAR T cells in melanoma or metastatic melanoma
   patients, a combination of epigenetic drugs and CAR T cells could be used to overcome
   this roadblock.
   4.3. Melanoma Resistant to CAR T Cell-Mediated Apoptosis
   Another obstacle in CAR T cell therapy, especially in the application of CAR T for
   melanoma patients, is the melanoma cell resistance to apoptosis. This occurs mainly
   because CAR T cell-mediated tumor cell killing mostly happens through inducing apoptosis
   in target cells \[203]. In line with this notion, it has been established that IGF-1 (insulin-like
   growth factor 1) plays a key role in inducing resistance to apoptosis in melanoma cells. It has
   been shown that IGF-1 increases expression of antiapoptotic members of the BCL2 family,
   and survivin (in both mRNA and protein levels) to protect mitochondria from damage that
   occurs during apoptosis \[204]. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing
   ligand (TRAIL) mediated apoptosis is another mechanism which immune cells use to kill
   cancer cells \[205]. It has been shown that some melanoma cells in patients are resistant
   to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis \[206]. A recent study has demonstrated that while fully
   functional anti-CD19 CAR T cells are able to effectively kill tumor cells, the administration
   of anti-CD19 CAR T cells with a TRAIL inhibitor can suppress the cytotoxic effect of the
   CAR T cell \[207], indicating the importance of TRAIL-mediated target cell killing as a key
   killing mechanism of CAR T cells. This finding may be applicable to CAR T cell therapy
   in the context of melanoma; however, it remains to be assessed. Interestingly, it has been
   reported that apoptosis resistance or partial apoptosis resistance of melanoma cells leads to
   their increased aggressiveness and metastasis ability by triggering the c-Jun N-terminal
   kinase (JNK) pathway, as the RNA sequencing signature of JNK pathway activation has
   been found to be similar to metastatic melanoma. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that
   partial apoptosis in melanoma cells results in enhanced cell adhesion, chemotaxis, increased
   melanoma migration and invasion \[208]. To overcome this challenge, it is suggested that
   Cells 2021, 10, 1450 16 of 29
   combination therapy using CAR T cells and (epi)drugs targeting antiapoptotic signaling
   pathway in melanoma cells could also be an interesting solution.
   4.4. Insufficient T Cell Infiltration and Penetration
   Another potential obstacle to the clinical efficacy of CAR T cell therapy is insufficient
   infiltration and penetration of the CAR T cells into the tumor mass. This could be caused
   by the stromal cells inhibiting the CAR T cell penetration, or interfering with the ability
   of CAR T cells to infiltrate properly into the tumor bed. Chemokines and their receptors
   can regulate the infiltration of various immune cells into the tumor site, and have been
   shown to be involved in tumor progression and angiogenesis \[209]. A study looking at
   metastatic melanoma biopsies showed that up-regulation of several chemokines, including
   CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10 could be correlated with the presence
   of T cells in the tumor \[210]. That study also showed that the corresponding chemokine
   receptors were also up-regulated in effector T cells. Therefore, up-regulation of chemokines
   and receptors could be used in CAR T cell therapy in metastatic melanoma patients to
   overcome insufficient infiltration of CAR T cells into the tumor site. In another study, temozolomide (TMZ), which is the most frequently used drug for metastatic melanoma patients,
   showed an increase in T cell infiltration in mouse models of transplanted melanoma and
   genitourinary tumors, but despite a similar increase in CXCL9 and CXCL10 in all sites after
   TMZ exposure, no increased infiltration of T cells was seen in the cutaneous tumor. This
   further showed that the combined use of collagenase plus TMZ could induce infiltration of
   T cells into a cutaneous tumor site \[211]. Thus, it can be concluded that stromal cells act as
   barriers in skin tumors, and the use of CAR T cells that target stromal cells could enhance
   T cell infiltration into the tumor site leading to a better clinical outcome. Furthermore, it
   has been shown by Caruana et al., that in vitro expanded T cells lacked expression of the
   heparinase (HPSE) enzyme. Heparinase can degrade heparan sulphate proteoglycans, an
   important component of the ECM. They further engineered CAR T cells expressing HPSE.
   Their results demonstrated improved efficacy of CAR T cells in degrading ECM along with
   enhanced infiltration and improved anti-tumor activity of CAR T cells \[212].
   The manipulation of CAR T cells to over-express specific chemokine receptors, and/or
   using agents to up-regulate chemokine expression in the tumor site, as well as targeting
   stromal cells by CAR T cells, could result in enhanced infiltration and penetration of CAR
   T cells into tumors.
   4.5. Immunosuppressive Tumor Microenvironment
   Each cancer has a specific environment in and around itself called the TME. The TME
   can suppress the cytotoxic activity of immune cells, and thus maintain tumor growth.
   The TME in metastatic melanoma is complex, with several factors including extracellular
   matrix, cytokines, growth factors, hypoxic conditions, and various cells such as fibroblasts
   and immune cells \[213,214]. All these factors working together can aid tumor growth
   and invasion, as well as decrease CAR T cell anti-tumor activity. Several attempts have
   been made to modify CAR T cells to overcome the hostile TME properties. For example,
   one study designed PD-1 knock-out TCR engineered T cells specific for the Melan-A antigen.
   They showed these engineered T cells had higher anti-tumor efficacy, and could delay
   the progression of PD-L1 positive melanoma tumors in NSG mice \[215]. The adenosine
   produced in the TME, can be used by melanoma cells to evade immune surveillance.
   Pharmacological or genetic targeting of the adenosine 2A receptor in CAR T cells resulted
   in enhanced anti-tumor activity of CAR T cells \[216,217]. Indeed, targeting other inhibitory
   receptors in CAR T cells could result in obtaining CAR T cells with superior anti-tumor
   activity in patients. In another study, the authors engineered anti-VEGFR-2 CAR T cells
   to constitutively express single-chain IL-12. Their engineered CAR T cells were able to
   cause regression of established tumors without exogenous IL-2 administration. They
   showed that anti–VEGFR-2 CAR T cells altered the immunosuppressive TME by reducing
   both systemic and intra-tumoral CD11b+ Gr1+ myeloid suppressor cell subsets \[218].
   Cells 2021, 10, 1450 17 of 29
   However, it should be noted that since not all immunosuppressive factors in the TME can
   be overcome by manipulating CAR T cells themselves, we will discuss additional solutions
   to the immunosuppressive TME in the “combination therapy” section.
5. Combination Therapy
   Combination therapies have been investigated, because single therapies in patients
   showed somewhat unsatisfactory results. As we discussed in this paper, metastatic
   melanoma cannot be easily treated with a single therapy, even with the best CAR T cells.
   Therefore, we discuss potential combination therapies that could be used in clinical trials
   in metastatic melanoma patients to increase their survival.
   One of the most attractive combination therapies is using an oncolytic virus (OV)
   in combination with CAR T cells. The first and only FDA approved oncolytic virus for
   the treatment of advanced melanoma is called Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) \[219].
   Other viral vectors, including Coxsackie viruses, adenovirus, HF-10, echovirus, reovirus,
   and Newcastle disease virus are currently under investigation \[220]. Previous review
   articles \[221,222] have suggested that oncolytic viruses are able to induce secretion of IFN
   type I in the TME, increase danger signals (PAMPs), reverse tumor immunosuppression,
   and enhance immune cell infiltration in the tumor site. Use of these viruses could increase
   CAR T cell infiltration, enhance TAA release by oncolytic virus-dependent tumor cell lysis,
   and promote the persistence, proliferation, and anti-tumor activity of CAR T cells in solid
   tumors. Thus, oncolytic viruses might be ideal partners for CAR T cells in tumor eradication.
   Several studies have pointed out the possible advantages of oncolytic viral therapy in
   combination with CAR T cells \[223–225]. However, more investigations in this field should
   be conducted on melanoma and metastatic melanoma tumors. Guedan et al. used an
   adenovirus expressing hyaluronidase in a melanoma xenograft model \[226]. They showed
   tumor regression and wide viral distribution following oncolytic adenovirus administration.
   This concept could be used in combination with CAR T cells to enhance CAR T cell
   infiltration into skin tumors such as melanoma and prevent melanoma metastasis.
   In a phase I clinical trial using GD2 targeted CAR T cells in metastatic melanoma
   patients who expressed GD2, up-regulation of LAG-3 and PD-1 expression was observed in
   stimulated CAR T cells \[227]. Thus, using checkpoint blockades in combination with CAR
   T cells in metastatic melanoma patients might increase overall survival. Another interesting
   approach to enhance checkpoint blockade efficacy in CAR T cell therapy is the use of armed
   oncolytic viruses expressing an anti-PD-L1 antibody \[223]. This approach could overcome
   obstacles against CAR T cells in solid tumors, benefiting from both immune checkpoint
   blockades and oncolytic virus therapy.
   A recent study showed that IFN type I secreted in response to oncolytic virus therapy
   can interfere with CAR T cell anti-tumor activity \[228]. They showed that combination use
   of OVs and CAR T cells injected on the same days did not provide superior anti-tumor
   effects (compared to either treatment alone) in mice bearing B16EGFRvIII tumor cells. Thus,
   it may be that precise scheduling of OV and CAR T cell injections could result in achieving
   better results.
   Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is well-established in combination with CAR T
   cell therapy. Melanoma was the first cancer type to be treated with immune checkpoint
   inhibitors (ICI) in the clinic. In 2011, ipilimumab (anti CTLA4) gained Food and Drug
   Administration (FDA) approval for treatment of metastatic melanoma \[229]. Shortly after,
   another ICI pembrolizumab (anti PD-1) was approved by the FDA in 2015 for patients
   with non-resectable or metastatic melanoma \[230]. Nowadays ICIs are considered standard
   care in metastatic melanoma patients. The combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab
   was shown to be the most efficient ICI therapy for advanced melanoma \[231,232]. However, this combination is associated with high levels of toxicity \[233]. In addition, the
   combination of ICI and CAR T cells has proven to be safe and effective in hematological
   malignancies \[234,235]. Several studies are in progress to assess the safety and efficacy
   of combinations of CAR T cells and ICI therapy in solid tumors, including glioblastoma
   Cells 2021, 10, 1450 18 of 29
   (NCT04003649, NCT03726515). Surprisingly, despite the mentioned advantages of ICI and
   CAR T cell combination therapies, there have yet been no studies or clinical trials to assess
   the efficacy and safety of combining these two promising anti-cancer therapies in advanced
   melanoma. Moreover, Chapuis et al., reported a single patient with advanced melanoma
   whose disease was refractory to both ICI monotherapy (ipilimumab) and monoclonal
   CTL therapy. However, the combination of IL-21 primed CTLs (MART1-specific CTLs)
   plus ipilimumab led to a durable complete remission in that patient \[236]. Furthermore,
   clinical trial results have shown that combining antigen-specific CTLs with ipilimumab
   (CTLA-4 blockade) is safe as well as effective, and could produce durable clinical responses
   in patients with metastatic melanoma \[237]. This result is promising for future combinations of CAR T cell therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced/metastatic
   melanoma patients.
   The inhibition or blockade of soluble molecules responsible for promoting metastasis
   in melanoma, including MMP1, MMP2, and MMP13 is another approach. Another possibility is the over-expression of soluble molecules that inhibit or decrease metastasis in
   melanoma, including PF4/CXCL4, TR47, and MMP8, which could be used in combination
   with CAR T cells that target surface molecules.

6. Conclusions
   In this review, we have summarized the mechanisms of melanoma metastasis to
   discover surface markers that can be used for CAR T cell therapy (Table 1). However, there
   are still some gaps in our knowledge that need to be fully addressed. So far, plenty of CAR T
   studies have described the engineering of CARs against cell surface targets, which take part
   in the metastatic process of melanoma. Some of these engineered CAR T cells have been
   investigated in preclinical studies and in clinical trials with remarkable results. Moreover,
   we discussed several potential markers for treatment of metastatic melanoma using CAR
   T cells alone or in combination with other types of immunotherapy. Nevertheless, more
   investigation needs to be done in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of newly proposed
   targets for CAR T cell therapy. Indeed, in the future a “surfaceome” analysis will need to
   be done, especially for leukocyte-cancer fusion cells to discover suitable target antigens on
   these cells that could be used in CAR T cell therapy. There are several challenges ahead
   involving the selection of target antigens and engineering new CAR T cells. Combination
   therapies can be a solution to some of these roadblocks. Using CAR T cells in combination
   with oncolytic viruses seems as if it may be an interesting possibility. Nevertheless, future
   studies need to be cautious about the possible adverse effects of combination treatments.
