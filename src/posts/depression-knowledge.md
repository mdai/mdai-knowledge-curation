# Assessment of Depression Guidelines 

## Source1

Researchers focus on the assessment of major depressive disorder in children and adolescents. Their methodology is as follows. 



Diagnostic evaluation is an essential prerequisite for the treatment of a depressive disorder. Specialized clinical education, training, and experience are necessary to conduct a diagnostic evaluation of a child or adolescent in accordance with current psychiatric nomenclature (DSM-5-TR1). A diagnostic evaluation identifies symptoms; syndromal symptom combinations; symptom frequency, severity, onset, and duration; degree of associated distress and functional impairment; developmental deviations; and physical signs, as well as factors predisposing, precipitating, perpetuating, or protecting from the symptom presentation.



Identification

The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for MDD in adolescents aged 12 to 18 years on the basis of conveying a “moderate net benefit,” provided that adolescents screening positive “are appropriately diagnosed and treated with evidence-based care.”85 At present, the USPSTF does not recommend screening for MDD in children aged 11 years or younger, based upon insufficient evidence of net benefit.85 Nonetheless, early identification of a depression concern in children as well as adolescents can facilitate early intervention, including guided self-management and focused intervention for sub-clinical and mild presentations.86

In primary care, school, or other child-serving settings, psychometrically sound and freely available general social−emotional screening instruments (eg, Pediatric Symptom Checklist \[https://www.massgeneral.org/psychiatry/treatments-and-services/pediatric-symptom-checklist],87 Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire \[https://www.sdqinfo.org]88) increasingly are deployed systematically (eg, well visits) to standardize identification of mental health concerns, including symptoms of sad or irritable mood, in pediatric primary care. However, for adolescents, the USPSTF suggests the use of a depression-focused instrument (such as the freely available Patient Health Questionnaire−989) for initial screening. When using this and other instruments that include suicidality items remotely (eg, via patient portal) in advance of well visits in primary care settings, consideration must be given to the management of a positive response to the suicidality question, which necessitates urgent assessment. For this reason, primary care settings using remote screening might consider the adolescent-validated,90 freely available PHQ-2 instrument, which does not include suicidality items (https://www.primarypediatrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PHQ-2-Depression-Scale.pdf),91 for the initial depression screen, to be followed by in-person administration of the PHQ-9 at the well visit if the PHQ-2 score is positive. For younger children, a similar remote screening consideration could be the child and adolescent−validated,92,  93,  94,  95freely available Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ), which does not include suicidality items, to be followed by in-person administration of the Long Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (LMFQ) at the well visit if the SMFQ score is positive (https://devepi.duhs.duke.edu/measures/the-mood-and-feelings-questionnaire-mfq/).96

In the context of a psychiatric evaluation, symptoms of depression typically are identified through input from referral sources; spontaneous youth or parent report (the presenting problem or chief complaint); or during the clinician’s review of psychiatric symptoms or the conduct of the mental status examination. However, because of the variability inherent in nonsystematic methods of identification, a more standardized approach to symptom review may be useful. As one option, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) developed the freely available parent- and self-rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures (https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm/educational-resources/assessment-measures)97 to screen for multiple psychiatric disorders including depression. Both the parent- and self-rated versions of the Level 1 Cross-Cutting measure have demonstrated good reliability in the DSM-5 field trials conducted in pediatric clinical samples across the United States.98 These instruments could be included in intake packets to systematically and efficiently gather information about presenting problems remotely, prior to the evaluation. As with remote use of the PHQ-9, remote administration of the Cross-Cutting measure must consider management of a positive response to the suicidality items, which necessitate urgent assessment; as such, the suicidality items may be deleted and deferred until the in-person visit.



Evaluation

Clinically significant depression (ie, a depressive disorder) must be distinguished from everyday sadness and irritability, which are common to the human experience and can be normative (even when exaggerated) in specific developmental stages (eg, irritability due to poor frustration tolerance in younger children, sad mood related to struggles with identity and intimacy in adolescents). In DSM-5-TR,1 mental disorders are defined as “a syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual’s cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying mental functioning.” By DSM convention,1 a mental disorder is diagnosed if all diagnostic criteria for the given disorder are met. Included in most diagnostic criteria sets is the requirement for a specific frequency and duration of symptoms as well as clinically significant distress and functional impairment, along with the caveat that alternative medical, substance, and psychiatric explanations for the symptom presentation must have been considered before the diagnosis is applied.1

In DSM-5-TR,1 diagnostic criteria are provided for 8 depressive disorders. a The common features of these disorders are sad or irritable mood accompanied by somatic, cognitive, and behavioral changes that significantly affect the individual’s capacity to cope and to function. Major Depressive Disorder, PDD, and Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition all have multiple specifiers that should also be coded; diagnostic precision is key for understanding disorder course and prognosis and for guiding empirically based treatment recommendations (eg, MDD with mixed features \[manic symptoms] may respond less well to treatment and may convey greater risk for developing bipolar disorder; MDD with anxious distress may respond better to combination treatment \[therapy and medication] than either treatment alone).63

According to DSM-5-TR,1 MDD is characterized by a discrete episode of at least 2 weeks’ duration (although most episodes last considerably longer) involving clear changes in mood, interest/pleasure, cognition, and neurovegetative functions; suicidality can also be present. Except for weight gain and suicidality, the criterion symptoms for MDD must be present for most of the day, nearly every day and must result in clinically significant distress or functional impairment. The initial presentation or chief complaint is variable: some youth present with sad or irritable mood, others with feelings of emptiness or boredom, others with somatic complaints, still others with social withdrawal, self-blame, or distractibility/poor school performance. Decreased energy, tiredness, and fatigue are common; self-care may decline. Suicidality may span thoughts of others being better off if the youth were dead, to transient but recurrent thoughts of committing suicide, to active suicidal intent and plan.

PDD is a chronic form of depression (duration at least 1 year) that incorporates previous DSM diagnoses of chronic major depression and dysthymia. If MDD persists for at least 1 year, a concurrent diagnosis of PDD can be considered (“double depression”) if PDD criteria are also met. A new diagnosis of MDD also can be superimposed upon a pre-existing PDD diagnosis if MDD criteria are also met. In PDD, the mood disturbance is present most of the day, more days than not; cognitive and neurovegetative dysfunction is present but is less severe and pervasive than in MDD. Nonetheless, PDD can be associated with substantial functional impairment over a long period of time.

If diagnostic criteria are not fully met for a specific depressive disorder or if a precise diagnosis is not possible because of limited information or other factors, DSM-5-TR includes “other specified” and “unspecified” diagnoses to be applied in these circumstances. The “other specified” or “unspecified” diagnoses can be applied when depressive symptoms do not meet full diagnostic criteria for a specific depressive disorder but are nonetheless distressing and functionally impairing. Subsyndromal symptoms are important to recognize, as they convey increased risk for developing full diagnostic criteria for depression as well as suicidality,99 and as such are an opportunity for early intervention. The “unspecified” diagnosis also may be a diagnostic option in the absence of detailed knowledge of DSM-5-TR criteria for specific depressive disorders (eg, emergency room or primary care settings).



Evaluation Structure

A diagnostic interview for depression includes the parent/guardian and patient, either separately or together or both, as developmentally and clinically indicated. Interview of the patient requires a developmentally sensitive approach that may employ multiple age-appropriate assessment techniques (eg, direct and indirect questioning, interactive and projective techniques). Family assessment can reveal genetic vulnerabilities to and environmental precipitants of depression, and observations of parenting styles and behaviors may identify those that are potentially contributory or protective. Input from collateral sources (eg, records, interviews, symptom rating scales), including (as applicable and with specific parent-guardian/patient consent) other family members, teachers, primary care and behavioral health clinicians, and/or child agency workers, can add depth and breadth to diagnostic information. Because of the multiple sources of information, a diagnostic evaluation of a child or adolescent may require more than one session as allowed by current diagnostic billing code (Current Procedural Terminology \[CPT] Codes 90791, 90792) specifications.

Clinicians should conduct the diagnostic evaluation in the language in which both the child and parents/guardians are proficient, as lack of appropriate linguistic ability or interpreter support has been associated with misdiagnosis as well as adverse clinical outcomes.100 If live interpreter services are not available, telephonic interpreter services may be an acceptable alternative.



Differential Diagnosis

When assessing depressive symptoms, a key goal of the history of present illness is to determine whether DSM-5-TR1 diagnostic criteria for a specific depressive disorder are met, and to rule out alternative explanations for the symptom presentation. In addition, characterization of previous depression presentations and response to previous treatments will inform current treatment choice.

Medical conditions associated with depression include (but are not limited to) hypothyroidism, mononucleosis, anemia, autoimmune diseases, chronic fatigue syndrome, migraine, epilepsy, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, and certain cancers. Although laboratory testing is not routine in the evaluation of a suspected depressive disorder, in collaboration with the child’s primary care practitioner, laboratory testing should be considered if suggested by signs and symptoms of a medical condition. For depressed youth presenting with specific somatic symptoms (eg, headaches, diarrhea, pain, fatigue), the nature and severity of those symptoms should be explored and documented at baseline, so that the somatic symptoms can be differentiated from adverse effects of a medication trial.

Medications that can cause depressive symptoms include (but are not limited to) narcotic analgesics, chemotherapy agents, cardiovascular medications, stimulants, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and oral contraceptives. Medication reconciliation including over-the-counter and naturopathic treatments should be performed as a routine part of an evaluation for a suspected depressive disorder.

A wide array of substances can cause depression, including (but not limited to) nicotine, alcohol, cannabis, opiates, cocaine, other stimulants, sedatives, and anabolic steroids. Environmental etiologies such as exposure to lead and carbon monoxide can also be considered. Although drug and toxin testing are not routine in the evaluation of a suspected depressive disorder, testing should be considered if exposure is reported or suspected.

Mental conditions that may include symptoms similar to those of depressive disorders are attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (distractibility), disruptive behavior disorders (irritability), anxiety (irritability, distractibility, insomnia, somatic complaints), posttraumatic stress disorder (irritability, distractibility, insomnia), bipolar depression (irritability), psychotic disorders (agitation, social withdrawal, distractibility), autism spectrum disorder (irritability, social withdrawal, distractibility), and learning disorders (sadness about school performance). Despite overlapping symptoms, each condition for which full diagnostic criteria are met should be diagnosed as such, unless DSM-5-TR hierarchical rules1 apply.



Psychiatric Comorbidities

As many as 40% to 90% of youth with depressive disorders have psychiatric comorbidities.63 Common comorbidities include (but are not limited to) anxiety, disruptive behavior, ADHD, and substance use disorders. Comorbidities may heighten distress and functional impairment and may worsen treatment outcomes. Each comorbid disorder may require a separate treatment plan and may influence the selection of treatment for the depressive disorder.

Use of the Parent- and Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures or screening questions embedded in structured interview guides can standardize and enhance the efficiency of the psychiatric review of symptoms to assess for psychiatric comorbidities. If screen questions on these instruments are positively endorsed, the ensuing interview can ascertain whether full diagnostic criteria are met for the given disorder.



Medical Comorbidities

Estimates of MDD prevalence in physically ill youth range from 11% to 29%.101 Strong associations between depression and physical illness have been found for youth with neurological, gastrointestinal, autoimmune, and endocrine disorders; infectious diseases; metabolic and systemic disturbances; neoplasms; and nutritional deficiencies. Depression and physical disorders variously can be coincidental, in which the depression that precedes or follows the physical disorder is related to factors other than the illness itself, or causal, in which the depression contributes to or results from the physical illness. Examples of causal associations include physical/physiological pathology secondary to depressive symptoms, depressive symptoms secondary to physical pathology/physiology, and depression as a reaction to physical illness and/or treatment. Whatever the presumed type of association, each disorder, whether physical or psychological, should be separately assessed and treated. Counting discrete symptoms (eg, fatigue) as attributable to both the depressive disorder as well as the physical illness may be the most sensitive and reliable approach to diagnosis.



Structured Interview Guides

Although the use of completely structured or semi-structured interviews is infrequent in nonresearch settings, such interviews have been shown to substantially enhance the reliability of psychiatric diagnosis over unstructured clinician interviews, which are vulnerable to a number of information collection biases.103 Structured interview guides for children and adolescents have generally similar, moderately acceptable psychometric properties; hence, the decision to use a structured interview as part of a diagnostic evaluation will depend upon consideration of the advantages (eg, enhanced diagnostic accuracy) and disadvantages (eg, time, training, cost, burden) specific to each situation and setting. A freely available option for screening for and assessing MDD and PDD is the K-SADS PL (Present and Lifetime) DSM-5 interview guide (https://www.pediatricbipolar.pitt.edu/sites/default/files/KSADS_DSM_5_Supp1_DepressiveDO_Final.pdf).104 The K-SADS-PL DSM-5 also includes screening (https://www.pediatricbipolar.pitt.edu/sites/default/files/KSADS_DSM_5_SCREEN_Final.pdf) and follow-up questions for other disorder categories, which can facilitate efficient identification of potential depression masqueraders and comorbidities. Also freely available online in draft form is a preschool-age structured interview guide, the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment (PAPA) for DSM-5 (https://devepi.duhs.duke.edu/files/2018/06/PAPA-Core-Diagnostic-Modules-DSM-5-1.pdf)105; although not yet proved to be psychometrically valid, this guide could be helpful in formulating questions for an unstructured clinical interview.



Focused Symptom Rating Scales

Albeit not diagnostic, standardized focused symptom rating scales can be useful to support a depression diagnosis, to characterize the nature and breadth of specific symptoms, and to quantify pretreatment symptom severity as a baseline for tracking response to treatment over time (“measurement-based treatment” 106,107). Among the several freely available depression rating scales with acceptable psychometric properties108,109 are the Patient Health Questionnaire−9 (PHQ-9) modified for adolescents110,  111,  112

(https://www.aacap.org/App_Themes/AACAP/docs/member_resources/toolbox_for_clinical_practice_and_outcomes/symptoms/GLAD-PC_PHQ-9.pdf); the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ), parent and child versions113,114

(https://devepi.duhs.duke.edu/measures/the-mood-and-feelings-questionnaire-mfq/); and the Preschool Feelings Checklist115

(www.jaacap.org/article/S0890-8567(09)61320-4/fulltext).

In addition, the APA offers the field-tested parent- and self-rated Level 2 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures for depression that explore depression endorsed on the Level 1 Measure (“mild” or greater on any depression item) in greater depth, and the self-rated Disorder-Specific Severity Measures for clinically diagnosed depression (https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm/educational-resources/assessment-measures).98,116

There is poor-to-moderate agreement between parent and youth reports on structured interview guides and symptom rating scales.117,118 However, discrepancies between informants are to be expected, as they reveal each informant’s unique view of the child’s depression symptoms, some of which are internal and may not be readily or accurately discerned by others. Although the youth’s report is generally considered to be paramount for internalizing disorders,119,120 the simple rule of regarding a symptom as being present by any informant’s report can be an acceptable resolution of discrepancies.

Measurement-based treatment may be underutilized in mental health care, despite evidence of improving outcomes.121 According to a recent systematic review, measurement-based treatment occurred primarily in outpatient mental health settings; around one-third of programs had provider-only assessments, and one-half had both provider and self-assessments.122 Perceived barriers to implementation of measurement-based treatment are many and occur at multiple levels: patient (eg, motivation, time, comfort/facility with applicable technologies, concerns about confidentiality breach); practitioner (eg, time, intrusive to clinical practice, disbelief in accuracy of measures, lack of training, concerns about impact on payments and coverage); organization (eg, lack of commitment by clinical leadership, infrastructure constraints, lack of training resources), and system (eg, competing requirements). Strategies to improve implementation include improving data input systems, using measurement feedback systems, leveraging local champions, forming learning collaboratives, training leadership, improving expert consultation with clinical staff, and generating incentives.123,124 Krishna et al.124 provide a useful guide to selecting and implementing various measurement infrastructure models suitable for a variety of settings.



Mental Status Examination

In the mental status examination, signs of depression can include poor eye contact, poor engagement/uncooperativeness, disheveled appearance, downcast facies, tearfulness, psychomotor agitation or retardation, sad mood, angry outbursts, poor frustration tolerance, distractibility, poverty of speech, perseverative or ruminative thought processes, guilt- or self-loathing- or self-blame−laden thought content, and poor insight and judgment. Because these signs are nonspecific to depression (and may be absent), they are largely adjunctive to other diagnostic information but should be documented when present.



Clinical Formulation

The development of a clinical formulation includes consideration of contextual (eg, stressors) and historical (eg, medical, developmental, educational, family, social) factors as well as child and family strengths, environmental supports, and gender/sexual/cultural/spiritual issues. The result is an understanding of the biological, psychological, and social factors that may be associated with the symptom presentation.

The biopsychosocial formulation can be organized to reflect predisposing, precipitating, perpetuating, and protective (ameliorating) factors (“4 P’s”)1 influencing the development of psychopathology.125 Predisposing factors are areas of vulnerability that increase the risk for psychopathology and encompass primarily the biological factors of the biopsychosocial formulation. Precipitating factors are stressors or other contextual events that have a chronologic association with symptom onset. Perpetuating factors are any aspects of the patient, family, or community that serve to prolong the problem. Protective (ameliorating) factors include the patient’s own areas of strength as well as strengths in the family and community. The cross-organization of both biopsychosocial and 4P factors can optimize the comprehensiveness of the treatment plan.



Safety

Safety risks, including but not limited to suicidal thoughts and behaviors, self-harm, risk-taking behaviors, and impulsivity, are assessed both at the time of evaluation and during treatment of a depressive disorder, as these risks have been associated with both depression and its treatment with antidepressant medications. Depressive disorders suggest the need for exploration of exposure to childhood adversities. In the case of abuse or neglect, reporting to the state child welfare authority is required. Gathering information from multiple sources and by varied culturally and developmentally sensitive techniques may be needed in evaluating safety risks. Assessment culminates in 2 basic questions: Is the patient at current risk? Are the patient and family able to adhere to recommendations regarding supervision, safeguarding, and follow-up care? The answers to these questions can lead to the appropriate level and intensity of care. Psychiatric hospitalization is likely indicated when the youth actively voices intent to harm, and in the context of altered mental status (including hopelessness, agitation, psychosis), multiple previous suicide attempts, previous unsuccessful treatment, and/or caregiver incapacity.



Treatment Planning

Treatment planning derives from the diagnoses and clinical formulation. High-quality treatment plans are safe, timely, effective, efficient, feasible, equitable, and child and family centered.126 A range of potentially effective treatments and other interventions should be explained in accordance with the cognitive and linguistic level of the parents/guardians and patient, prioritized according to the acuity, severity, distress, and impairment associated with each diagnosed disorder. The clinician should provide sufficient information to enable the patient and parent/guardian to make an informed decision about treatment options. Level of care decisions are informed by diagnosis, the current severity of symptoms, the presence of comorbid medical or psychiatric disorders, the assessment of the child’s risk to self or others, the child’s prior illness course and complications, the child’s potential supports, and the treatment alliance between the clinician and the child and family.

Although the specific definition of informed consent for treatment may vary from state to state,127 many stakeholders agree on at least 4 basic elements of the informed consent process: (1) the decision maker (parent/guardian and older youth) should have the capacity to make decisions; (2) the clinician should disclose sufficient details for the decision maker to make an informed choice; (3) the decision maker should confirm his/her understanding of the disclosed information; and (4) the decision maker should freely authorize the treatment plan. In clinical practice, these 4 elements translate into 5 components that are included in a discussion seeking to obtain informed consent: (1) the diagnosis; (2) the nature and purpose of the proposed treatment; (3) the attendant risks and benefits of the proposed treatment; (4) alternative treatments and their risks and benefits; and (5) the risks and benefits of declining treatment. Strategies for improving parents’/guardians’ and patients’ comprehension of risks and benefits can include providing written educational materials, multimedia presentations, decision-making worksheets, and standardized consent forms; asking for a “repeat back” of information provided; and engaging in extended back-and-forth discussions until understanding is achieved. Documentation of the informed consent process provides evidence that the patient and parent/guardian were adequately prepared to provide assent and consent for treatment.

Clinicians should evaluate and incorporate cultural and spiritual values, beliefs, and attitudes in treatment interventions to enhance the child’s and family’s participation in treatment and treatment effectiveness.100 If available, clinicians should preferentially recommend treatments that have been proved to be effective in the minority population in question, and should identify ethnopharmacologic factors (eg, pharmacogenomic, dietary, herbal) that may influence the child’s response to medications or experience of adverse effects.

Together with the patient and family, the clinician can delineate the role of each participant in the treatment process, emphasizing that successful treatment is a collaborative effort among all involved parties. Parents/guardians who themselves struggle with depression can benefit from additional psychoeducation and support to foster their child’s successful depression management, and for moderate-to-severe cases, a referral for parental treatment can be considered. Families struggling with difficult psychosocial circumstances can be referred to social services agencies for needed supports. The clinician should address any questions or disagreements about treatment and discuss the logistics of treatment implementation. The clinician should inquire about the parents’ understanding of the outcomes of the assessment and their feelings about the process. Finally, the clinician should support and encourage the youth and parents/guardians in their efforts to adhere to the treatment plan.

Feedback to the patient’s care team is generally permissible with basic consent for treatment, although regulations vary by state. If parents/guardians specifically consent, information from systems involved with the patient (eg, medical, educational, juvenile justice, child welfare) can facilitate coordination of care. Feedback should be prompt, concise, jargon free, and helpful; for example, comments may include a brief reiteration of the presenting problem/reason for referral, a description of the assessment process, the diagnoses given, and the treatments recommended.

As with remote use of the PHQ-9, remote administration of the Cross-Cutting measure must consider management of a positive response to the suicidality items, which necessitate urgent assessment; as such, the suicidality items may be deleted and deferred until the in-person visit.

How to assess MDD. MDD is defined by the experience of sad mood or anhedonia (a loss of interest or pleasure) persisting nearly all day, every day for at least two weeks, which distinguishes it from an occasional sad mood or lack of interest that lasts for a few hours or days. For a diagnosis, four additional symptoms are required, including weight loss or gain; sleep disruptions; slowing down or speeding up of physical movements; fatigue or loss of energy; thoughts of worthlessness; difficulty with decision-making; and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. Symptoms should cause significant distress or impairment in functioning and should not be attributable to drug abuse, medication changes, or medical conditions (e.g., hypothyroidism). Individuals with MDD may also experience significant anxiety, somatization and even psychosis; it increases the risk of suicide and for and morbidity and mortality associated with other medical and psychiatric conditions.



Clinical presentation poses significant variability since individuals do not experience all the same symptoms. And symptom severity, frequency, and duration can differ across individuals and fluctuate over time in the same individual. Some may have a very persistent symptoms that do not remit over a long period of time, and others may have many years of symptom remission between discrete episodes. Generally two out of five people with MDD begin to recover within three months of onset; recovery begins within one year of onset for four out of five people. The longer the current episode, the longer recovery generally takes. The presence of mild to moderate symptoms during a period of symptom recovery is a powerful predictor of whether MDD will occur again. Also several recognized subtypes of depression may require specific treatment, including psychotic depression (hallucinations and/or delusions that occur only in the context of the depressive episode) and atypical depression (normal or exaggerated mood reactivity and often significantly increased sleep and appetite).



# Health Advisory 



## What young people can do 

* Remember that mental health challenges are real, common, and treatable. Struggling with your mental health does not mean you are broken or that you did something wrong. Mental health is shaped by many factors.



* Ask for help. Find trusted adults, friends, or family members to talk to about stressful situations. Reach out to a school nurse or counselor, a teacher, a parent or caregiver, a coach, a faith leader, or someone else you look up to and trust. 



* Invest in healthy relationships. Social connection is a powerful buffer to stress and a source of wellbeing. Get involved in group activities, such as recreation and outdoor activities, afterschool programs, and mentorship programs.



* Find ways to serve. Volunteering in your community and helping others can be a great way to connect with people



* Learn and practice techniques to manage stress and other difficult emotions. Try to recognize situations that may be emotionally challenging for you, and come up with strategies to manage those emotions. 



* Take care of your body and mind. Stick to a schedule, eat well, stay physically active, get quality sleep, stay hydrated, and spend time outside.



* Be intentional about your use of social media, video games, and other technologies. 



* Be a source of support for others. Talk to your family and friends about mental health, listen and be a source of support to them, and connect them to the right resources.



## What family members and caregivers can do:

* Be the best role model you can be for young people by taking care of your own mental and physical health. Young people often learn behaviors and habits from what they see around them. You can model good habits by talking to children about the importance of mental health, seeking help when you need it, and showing positive ways you deal with stress so children learn from you.



* Help children and youth develop strong, safe, and stable relationships with you and other supportive adults. 



* Encourage children and youth to build healthy social relationships with peers. 



* Do your best to provide children and youth with a supportive, stable, and predictable home and neighborhood environment. 



* Try to minimize negative influences and behaviors in young people’s lives. Talk to children early about the risks of alcohol and other drugs, both short-term (such as car crashes and other accidents) and long-term (such as reduced cognitive abilities). 



* Ensure children and youth have regular check-ups with a pediatrician, family doctor, or other health care professional. Health care professionals can help you monitor your children's health, give you advice on how to prevent problems, and diagnose and treat physical and mental illnesses. 



* Look out for warning signs of distress, and seek help when needed. Signs of distress in children can show up in a number of ways, such as irritability, anger, withdrawal, and other changes in their thoughts, appearance, performance at school, sleeping or eating patterns, or other behaviors.)



* Minimize children’s access to means of self-harm, including firearms and prescription medications. Dispose of unused or expired prescriptions and keep medications out of reach for children and youth. 



* Be attentive to how children and youth spend time online. Digital technology can help young people connect with friends and family, learn about current events, express themselves, and access telehealth and other resources. 



* Be a voice for mental health in your community. There are many ways to do this, from talking openly with friends and family about the importance of mental health, to going to school board meetings or a town hall, to volunteering with an advocacy group, to promoting greater funding and awareness of mental health programs in schools and local organizations, such as churches, libraries, parks and recreation, or sports teams



## What educators, school staff, etc could do:

* Create positive, safe, and affirming school environments. This could include developing and enforcing anti-bullying policies, training students and staff on how to prevent harm (e.g., implementing bystander interventions for staff and students), being proactive about talking to students and families about mental health, and using inclusive language and behaviors.
* Expand social and emotional learning programs and other evidence-based approaches that promote healthy development.



* Learn how to recognize signs of changes in mental and physical health among students, including trauma and behavior changes. Take appropriate action when needed.148 Educators are often the first to notice if a student is struggling or behaving differently than usual (for example, withdrawing from normal activities or acting out). 



* Provide a continuum of supports to meet student mental health needs, including evidence-based prevention practices and trauma-informed mental health care. 



* Expand the school-based mental health workforce.152 This includes using federal, state, and local resources to hire and train additional staff, such as school counselors, nurses, social workers, and school psychologists, including dedicated staff to support students with disabilities. 



* Support the mental health of all school personnel. Opportunities include establishing realistic workloads and student-to-staff ratios, providing competitive wages and benefits (including health insurance with affordable mental health coverage), regularly assessing staff wellbeing, and integrating wellness into professional development.155 



* Promote enrolling and retaining eligible children in Medicaid, CHIP, or a Marketplace plan, so that children have health coverage that includes behavioral health services. 



* Protect and prioritize students with higher needs and those at higher risk of mental health challenges, such as students with disabilities, personal or family mental health challenges, or other risk factors (e.g., adverse childhood experiences, trauma, poverty).



## What Health Care Organizations and Health Professionals Can Do

* Identify and address the mental health needs of parents, caregivers, and other family members. The mental health of children and youth is closely linked to the mental health and wellbeing of their families. 



* Combine the efforts of clinical staff with those of trusted community partners and child-serving systems (e.g., child welfare, juvenile justice). F



* Build multidisciplinary teams to implement services that are tailored to the needs of children and their families. Enlist children and families as partners and engage them in all stages of decisionmaking, from screening to treatment.



## What Media Organizations, Entertainment Companies, and Journalists Can Do

* Recognize the impact media coverage of negative events can have on the public’s mental health. The solution isn't to hide or downplay negative news, but rather to avoid misleading consumers, and to be more attentive to how stories are framed.



* Normalize stories about mental health and mental illness across all forms of media, taking care to avoid harmful stereotypes, promote scientifically accurate information, and include stories of help, hope, and healing.
* Whenever depicting suicide or suicidal ideation, adhere to best practices such as the National Recommendations for Depicting Suicide.

* Ensure that programs rigorously evaluate mental health-related outcomes.
* Address the unique mental health needs of at-risk youth, such as racial and ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ youth, and youth with disabilities.

## What Funders and Foundations Can Do

* Create sustained investments in equitable prevention, promotion, and early intervention.
* Incentivize coordination across grantees and foster cross-sector partnerships to maximize reach and bring together a diversity of expertise.
