**How common is breast cancer?**

* Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in the United States, except for skin cancers. It is about 30% (or 1 in 3) of all new female cancers each year.
* The American Cancer Society's estimates for breast cancer in the United States for 2023 are: 

  * About 297,790 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in women. 
  * About 55,720 new cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) will be diagnosed.  
  * About 43,700 women will die from breast cancer.
* Breast cancer mainly occurs in middle-aged and older women. The median age at the time of breast cancer diagnosis is 62. This means half of the women who developed breast cancer are 62 years of age or younger when they are diagnosed.  A very small number of women diagnosed with breast cancer are younger than 45.

**Lifetime chance of getting breast cancer**

Overall, the average risk of a woman in the United States developing breast cancer sometime in her life is about 13%. This means there is a 1 in 8 chance she will develop breast cancer. This also means there is a 7 in 8 chance she will never have the disease. 

**Trends in breast cancer incidence**

In recent years, incidence rates have increased by 0.5% per year.

**Trends in breast cancer deaths**

* Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women. (Only lung cancer kills more women each year.) The chance that a woman will die from breast cancer is about 1 in 39 (about 2.5%).
* Breast cancer death rates have been decreasing steadily since 1989, for an overall decline of 43% through 2020. The decrease in death rates is believed to be the result of finding breast cancer earlier through screening and increased awareness, as well as better treatments. However, the decline has slowed slightly in recent years.Differences by race and ethnicity
* Some variations in breast cancer can be seen in racial and ethnic groups. For example:  
* The median age at diagnosis is slightly younger for Black women (60 years old) compared to White women 63 years old).
* Black women have the highest death rate from breast cancer. This is thought to be partially because about 1 in 5 Black women with breast cancer have triple-negative breast cancer  -  more than any other racial or ethnic group.
* Black women have a higher chance of developing breast cancer before the age of 40 than White women.
* At every age, Black women are more likely to die from breast cancer than any other race or ethnic group.
* White, Asian, and Pacific Islander women are more likely to be diagnosed with localized breast cancer than Black, Hispanic, American Indian, and Alaska Native women.  
* Asian and Pacific Islander women have the lowest death rate from breast cancer.
* American Indian and Alaska Native women have the lowest rates of developing breast cancer.

**Breast cancer survivors**

* At this time there are more than 3.8 million breast cancer survivors in the United States. This includes women still being treated and those who have completed treatment.
