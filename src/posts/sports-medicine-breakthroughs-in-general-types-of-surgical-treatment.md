#### Breakthroughs in General Types of Surgical Treatment 

1. **Arthroscopic Surgery:** Earlier procedures used open surgical techniques. Now [arthroscopic surgery is used in sports medicine](https://www.eliteorthopaedic.com/blog/orthopedic-procedures/what-is-arthroscopic-surgery/), which has revolutionized the treatment of injuries and returns the injured player back to the playing field in a shorter time period. Suture anchor, which is a simple way of attaching soft tissue to bone, is now used, replacing more invasive techniques like the use of bone tunnels and additional fixation, which required a longer operation time. Meniscus transplantation allows surgeons to treat only the damaged part of the knee without performing a full knee replacement
2. **Biologic Solutions:** Sports medicine physicians have introduced [platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections](https://www.painscience.com/articles/platelet-rich-plasma-does-it-work.php), and it has worked better when it comes to major body repairs. Using a musculoskeletal ultrasound for injection advice, there have been excellent results with PRP. The injections have helped patients with partial tears from throwing injuries. Athletes can return back to sports faster now than they would have otherwise.
3. **ACL Reconstruction:** Although the [single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament repair process](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19329787) has been very successful, the post-surgery attrition rate is also very high. So a double-bundle technique has arrived, which strengthens the rotational and front-back stability. Athletes who undergo [double-bundle ACL reconstruction](https://www.healio.com/orthopedics/sports-medicine/news/print/orthopedics-today/%7Ba812a44a-7fbd-4183-b508-9250c84ff4f6%7D/anatomic-double-bundle-acl-reconstruction) can perform cutting and pivoting motions with a reduced chance of re-injury.
4. **New Computer Technology:** Over the past few years, there has been a great advancement in computer technology, which is applied to medicine as it relates to the [biomechanics of the player](https://thecoachingfamily.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/biomechanics-of-football.pdf). For instance, computers can now predict how and what injuries may happen, and can treat it through different methods like multi-plane ultrasound and fluoroscopy.
5. **Improved Surgical Technique:** One of the recent developments in the field of surgery is the application of safer methods to [remove injured tissue through minimal invasive technology](https://www.aans.org/Patients/Neurosurgical-Conditions-and-Treatments/Minimally-Invasive-Spine-Surgery). Ultrasound waves are also used in this regard. The removal of the injured tissue and biologic regeneration have become possible due to advances in surgical techniques with minimally invasive instruments that can support such procedures.
6. **Hip Surgery:** [Hip impingement](https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/diseases--conditions/femoroacetabular-impingement) is a common phenomenon with top athletes. How much one will suffer will depend on factors like the degree the acetabulum was rotated. Other factors such as whether it is tilted, or how much the socket has been affected, has to be looked at also. The amount of rotation of the bone on the femoral head injunction with the femur is another thing that cannot be forgotten. Today, hip surgeries aren’t as intrusive as they were. In fact, they are among the [minimally invasive orthopedic procedures available](https://www.newyorkorthopedics.com/2015/12/16/latest-minimally-invasive-surgery-options-in-orthopedics-ny/) today, which makes them a great bet for athletes.

   * In hip arthroscopy, an arthroscope is inserted into the hip joint through a small incision, while surgical tools are inserted through other incisions. As with other types of arthroscopy, the surgeon views the joint and manipulates the instruments using the enlarged images provided by the arthroscope. [Hip arthroscopy](https://newyorkorthopedics.com/2015/10/what-you-need-to-know-when-considering-hip-arthroscopy-in-ny/) can help relieve painful symptoms of many problems impacting the labrum, articular cartilage, or other soft tissues surrounding the hip joint.
   * Hip arthroscopy may be used to treat:

     * Hip injuries
     * Hip dysplasia
     * Femoroacetabular impingement
     * Loose bodies in joint
     * Synovitis
     * Hip joint infection
7. **Better Pain Injections:** Ultrasound technology has been around for decades, but its [use in musculoskeletal pain management](https://bjaed.org/article/S1743-1816(17)30093-8/fulltext) purposes is just beginning to unfold. Once it is adapted for joint injections, physicians will be able to administer the injection in the exact spot needed.
8. Ultrasound has a number of distinct advantages compared with other imaging modalities,﻿ and it is considered the diagnostic investigation of choice for a number of musculoskeletal problems.

   1. It is highly tolerable and acceptable to patients, there are no contraindications, and it is safe to use with MRI incompatible devices. It is highly portable, provides high-resolution images of soft tissue structures, and avoids exposure to ionizing radiation. Diagnostic and therapeutic interventions can be carried out during the same clinic visit, which benefits both patients and institutions.
   2. Another significant advantage is the capability to perform a targeted and dynamic assessment. Static images produced by MRI or CT are usually interpreted at a remote site, whereas, with ultrasound, the sonographer can interact with the patient, and focus their examination accordingly. Images obtained during movement or against resistance may reveal occult pathology not apparent at rest, and whose symptoms may have been inadvertently attributed to ‘incidental findings’. This dynamic assessment is strengthened by the ability to alter the field of view, and make comparisons with opposite structures. In addition, the use of Doppler allows a real-time appreciation of blood flow.
   3. Limitations include technical factors such as a reduction in resolution with increasing depth, poor penetration of bone, and a small viewing footprint. The technique is operator dependent, and a significant amount of time is required to gain expertise.
   4. It is essential to have a working knowledge of the normal and abnormal ultrasound appearances of musculoskleletal structures, and these are outlined in Table [1](https://www.bjaed.org/article/S1743-1816(17)30093-8/fulltext#tbl1). Structures can be broadly differentiated by their anatomical course, echogenicity, echotexture, compressibility, anisotropy, and Doppler flow characteristics.

9. **Robotic Technology:** [Advanced computer-aided robotic technology is available now for partial knee and hip replacement procedures](https://www.uosortho.com/services/computer-assisted-joint-replacement). Computer software takes a three-dimensional CT scan of the patient's anatomy and allows the surgeons to plan their procedures. The plans are then fed to the robot through the software, which guides the surgeons in their operation.
10. **Spine Surgery:** Athletes stress their spinal cords quite a bit, which potentially leads to fractures and other painful conditions. Modern technology has made it possible to perform [minimally invasive surgery](https://www.aans.org/Patients/Neurosurgical-Conditions-and-Treatments/Minimally-Invasive-Spine-Surgery) and return athletes to play within a year. When athletes incur an injury to their spinal cord, they are able to go through diagnosis and treatment much faster than they used to in the past, which increases their chances of recovery.

    * In general, the goal of minimally invasive spine (MIS) surgery is to stabilize the vertebral bones and spinal joints and/or relieve pressure being applied to the spinal nerves — often a result of conditions such as spinal instability, bone spurs, herniated discs, scoliosis or spinal tumors.

    * As opposed to open spine surgery, minimally invasive surgical approaches can be faster, safer and require less recovery time. Because of the reduced trauma to the muscles and soft tissues (compared to open procedures), the potential benefits are:

    1. * Better cosmetic results from smaller skin incisions (sometimes as small as several millimeters)

       * Less blood loss from surgery

       * Reduced risk of muscle damage, since less or no cutting of the muscle is required

       * Reduced risk of infection and postoperative pain

       * Faster recovery from surgery and less rehabilitation required

       * Diminished reliance on pain medications after surgery

       * In addition, some MIS surgeries are performed as outpatient procedures and utilize only local anesthesia — so there is less risk for an adverse reaction to general anesthesia.
    2. As with any surgical procedure, no matter how minimal, there are **certain risks** associated that include, but are not limited to:
    3. * Possible adverse reaction to the anesthetic

       * Unexpected blood loss during the procedure

       * Localized infections, no matter how small the incision are

       * And, though uncommon, there is always a small chance that the initial MIS surgery cannot be completed, requiring either a second procedure or full open surgery.
    4. **Conditions Treated Using MIS Procedures**
    5. * Degenerative disc disease

       * Herniated disc

       * Lumbar spinal stenosis

       * Spinal deformities such as scoliosis

       * Spinal infections

       * Spinal instability including spondylolisthesis

       * Vertebral compression fractures

       * Spinal tumors
    6. **How Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery Works:** Because the spinal nerves, vertebrae and discs are located deep inside the body, any approach to gain access to the spinal area requires moving the muscle tissue out of the way. In general, this is facilitated by utilizing a small incision(s) and guiding instruments and/or microscopic video cameras through these incisions. Contrary to popular belief, lasers are very rarely used in MIS surgeries.
    7. **A number of methods can be used to minimize trauma during MIS surgery.** Some of the more common techniques are:

       * **Using a Tubular Retractor:** This technique involves progressive dilation of the soft tissues, as opposed to cutting directly through the muscles. By using tubes to keep the muscles out of the way, the surgeon works through the incision without having to expose the area widely. Sometimes, the surgeon will also utilize an endoscope or microscope focused down the tube to assist with performing the surgery through a minimal access strategy. Once the procedure is complete, the tubular retractor can be removed, allowing the dilated tissues to come back together. Depending on the extent and type of surgery necessary, incisions can often be small.

       * **Percutaneous Placement of Screws and Rods:** Depending on the condition of the patient, it may be necessary to place instrumentation, such as rods and screws, to stabilize the spine or to immobilize the spine to facilitate fusion of the spinal bones. Traditional approaches for placement of screws requires extensive removal of muscle and other tissues from the surface of the spine. However, percutaneous (meaning “through the skin”) placement typically involves inserting rods and screws through relatively small skin incisions without cutting or dissecting the underlying muscle. With the aid of x-ray images, guidewires are placed through the skin and into the spinal vertebrae along the desired paths for the screws. Then, screws are placed over the guidewires and follow the path of the wires. These screws have temporary extenders that extend outside of the skin and are subsequently removed after helping to guide passage of rods to connect and secure the screws. With the use of spinal navigation and robots, spinal instrumentation is being placed more safely and accurately.

       * **Direct Lateral Access Routes:** In some cases, especially those involving the lumbar spine, approaching the spine from the side of the body results in reduced pain, due to the limited amount of muscle tissue blocking the way. This approach is typically performed with the patient on his or her side. Then, a tubular retractor docks on the side of the spine to enable access to the spine’s discs and bones.

       * **Thoracoscopic Access Route:** Depending on the patient's condition, it may be necessary to access the front portions of the [thoracic spine](http://www.spine-health.com/conditions/spine-anatomy/thoracic-spine-anatomy-and-upper-back-pain), located in the chest and surrounded by the heart and lungs. Traditional access approaches often involve opening the chest through large incisions that may also require removal of one or more ribs. However, thoracoscopic access relies on multiple small incisions, through which working ports and cameras can be inserted to facilitate surgery.
    8. **Common MIS Surgery Treatment Options:** A number of specific techniques have been deployed for MIS surgery. Though the field continues to develop, the list below highlights some of the most common options.

       * **Discectomy**: Spinal discs are essentially elastic rings with soft material inside that serve as cushions between the vertebral bones. If the elastic ring becomes weakened, the soft tissue inside can extrude — or herniate — outside of the elastic ring. The herniated disc material can compress the nerves passing by, thus causing pain. If surgical treatment is recommended to trim or remove the herniated disc, it may be possible to perform this procedure with MIS surgery using tubular dilators and a microscope or endoscope.

       * **Spinal decompression:** Spinal stenosis, which is a narrowing of the vertebral canal, is a common condition that can result in compression of the nerves. This can produce a variety of symptoms, including pain, numbness and muscle weakness. If surgery is recommended, it may be possible to remove the bone and soft tissues causing the nerve compression through an MIS approach using tubular dilators and a microscope or endoscope. The more common decompressive procedures include laminectomy and foraminotomy.

       * **Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion (TLIF):** This is a MIS technique that is performed for patients with refractory mechanical low back and radicular pain associated with spondylolisthesis, degenerative disc disease and recurrent disc herniation. The procedure is performed from the back (posterior) with the patient on his or her stomach. Utilizing two small incisions, screws and rods are placed between two or more vertebral levels. The intervertebral disc is removed and a cage filled with bone is placed in that void with the goal of stabilizing the levels affected.
