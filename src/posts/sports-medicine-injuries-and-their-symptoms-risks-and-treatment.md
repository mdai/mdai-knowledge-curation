#### Signs and Symptoms of a Concussion

* Balance problems
* Confusion
* Difficulty concentrating
* Difficulty remembering
* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Feeling mentally foggy
* Feeling slowed down or just “not right”
* Feeling sluggish or fatigued
* Headache, pressure in head
* Irritability
* Loss of consciousness
* Loss of memory of events before or after head trauma
* More emotional, nervousness or sadness than usual
* Nausea, vomiting
* Neck pain
* Nervousness
* Numbness or tingling
* Seizures
* Sensitivity to light
* Sensitivity to noise
* Trouble sleeping
* Vision changes, double vision, blurred vision

##### **There are six categories of concussion symptoms:** cognitive/fatigue, vestibular, ocular, post-traumatic migraine, cervical and anxiety/mood. If you are experiencing these symptoms after a concussion in sports or in general, a doctor must be contacted immediately Cognitive/Fatigue

1. ###### **Vestibular:** The vestibular system is the balance center of the brain. Symptoms may include the inability to interpret motion or difficulty stabilizing vision upon head movement.
2. ###### **Ocular: You may experience difficulties bringing your eyes together or tracking motion.**
3. ###### **Post-Traumatic Migraine: Symptoms include headache, nausea and sensitivity to light or noise.**
4. ###### **Cervical: If a concussive blow affects the extra-cranial region, including the neck and/or spinal cord, you may experience ongoing headaches.**
5. #### **Anxiety/Mood: Symptoms associated with anxiety/mood may include ruminating thoughts or excessive worry.** ﻿                                                                                                                                                                           Updates on Specific Treatments for Concussions   

###### **As per 2023 and the NCAA, clinicians and expert researchers around the world, like NCAA Chief Medical Officer Brian Hainline have released an updated consensus statement on concussion in sport with new scientific evidence on concussion diagnosis, management, and prevention** 

1. Among the recommendations included are stronger evidence for the  recovery benefits of light intensity aerobic exercise within the first 48 hours following a concussion and new targetted approaches to concussion rehabilitation, like cervicovestibular rehabilitation for post-concussive neck pain, headaches, dizziness and/or balance problems. 

   1. For children and adolescents specifically, new research shows that the treatment protocol for concussions has shifted from keeping them resting and out of school, to encouraging kids to return to school and light activity after only a couple days of rest. 
   2. 1. Studies show significant associations between an earlier return to school and improved symptoms for kids 8 and above, as prologned activity restriction and isolation can instead raise risks for anxiety and depression. There isn’t enough data to suggest a correlation for those aged 5-7, so this advice should only be given within the studied age range. 
   3. Age should also be considered for the SCAT5, which is a standardized tool for evaluating a suspected concussion. It should only be used on individuals 13 and under. For children under this age, it must be described that the Child SCAT5 should be utilized. The SCAT5 supersedes the original SCAT (2005), the SCAT2 (2009), and the SCAT3 (2013).  The SCAT5 scoring summary includes the following questions
   4. 1. Red flags
      2. Memory assessment – Maddocks Questions
      3. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) examination
      4. Cervical spine assessment
      5. Symptom evaluation
      6. Cognitive screening
      7. Neurological screening
      8. Balance examination
      9. Delayed recall
   5. As of 2023, there are also new ICD-10 diagnosis codes that document concussions and brain injuries with further specificity. Suggesting getting a specific diagnosis and code can thus help patients and their sports physicians get a better understanding of what treatments and procedures may work best to alleviate symptoms and decrease its prevalence. 
   6. 1. Example: A new ICD-10 code is “external causes of injury” → deepens diagnosis coding options for different types of concussions and brain injuries
      2. The following code(s) above S09.90XA contain annotation back-references that may be applicable to S09.90XA:
      3. 1. [S00-S09](https://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/S00-T88/S00-S09)  Injuries to the head
         2. S[09.90](https://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/S00-T88/S00-S09/S09-/S09.90)  Unspecified injury of head
      4. Coders will also find 86 new codes related to head injuries including the following concussion codes: 
      5. 1. S06.0XAA, concussion with loss of consciousness status unknown, initial encounter
         2. S06.0XAD, concussion with loss of consciousness status unknown, subsequent encounter
         3. S06.0XAS, concussion with loss of consciousness status unknown, sequela

Concussion Management:**

There has been a spurt in concussion awareness among athletes because of the [link found between concussions and neurological issues](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/01/170112110804.htm). People were not concerned about concussions earlier, and the extent of damage was judged on the basis of symptoms. Players were allowed to play if they were feeling well enough. Apart from neurocognitive testing, team physicians now monitor balance/memory tests to ensure the athlete fully recovered. 

* New research has found concussions accelerate Alzheimer's disease-related brain atrophy and cognitive decline in people who are at genetic risk for the condition. The findings, which appear in the journal Brain, show promise for detecting the influence of concussion on neurodegeneration. Moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury is one of the strongest environmental risk factors for developing neurodegenerative diseases such as late-onset Alzheimer's disease, although it is unclear whether mild traumatic brain injury or concussion also increases this risk.

* Researchers from Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) studied 160 Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans, some who had suffered one or more concussions and some who had never had a concussion. Using MRI imaging, the thickness of their cerebral cortex was measured in seven regions that are the first to show atrophy in Alzheimer's disease, as well as seven control regions."We found that having a concussion was associated with lower cortical thickness in brain regions that are the first to be affected in Alzheimer's disease," explained corresponding author Jasmeet Hayes, PhD, assistant professor of psychiatry at BUSM and research psychologist at the National Center for PTSD, VA Boston Healthcare System. "Our results suggest that when combined with genetic factors, concussions may be associated with accelerated cortical thickness and memory decline in Alzheimer's disease relevant areas." Of particular note was that these brain abnormalities were found in a relatively young group, with the average age being 32 years old. "These findings show promise for detecting the influence of concussion on neurodegeneration early in one's lifetime, thus it is important to document the occurrence and subsequent symptoms of a concussion, even if the person reports only having their "bell rung" and is able to shake it off fairly quickly, given that when combined with factors such as genetics, the concussion may produce negative long-term health consequences," said Hayes.

* The researchers hope that others can build upon these findings to find the precise concussion-related mechanisms that accelerate the onset of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, Parkinson's and others. "Treatments may then one day be developed to target those mechanisms and delay the onset of neurodegenerative pathology," she added.             **Most Common Types of Injuries**        

1. **Ligament Injuries or Sprains** – A stretch, twist or tear in a ligament, the pieces of tissue that connect bones. Common ligament injuries include the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), Ulnar collateral ligament of the elbow (UCL or Tommy John injury) and ankle sprains.  
2. **Strains** – A stretch, twist or tear in a tendon or area of muscle, a strong, fibrous tissue that connects muscles to bones. Common strains include mild ankle sprains or pulled muscle.
3. **Soft tissue injuries** – A trauma or damage inflicted on a muscle, ligament or tendon. 
4. **Knee injuries** – Can include sprains, strains, bursitis, dislocations, fracture, meniscus tears, ligament tears and overuse injuries.
5. **Swollen and sore muscles** – Swelling and soreness can be the result of impact or strain and can also happen after new exercise and muscle growth.
6. **Achilles tendon rupture or tear** – This large lower leg tendon can be damaged or torn if stretched beyond its capacity.
7. **Dislocations** – An injury to a joint where a bone is dislodged from its socket and leads to pain, swelling and immobility of the affected area.
8. **Fractures** – A slight crack or even completely broken bone, usually as the result of a high force impact or stress to the bone.
9. **Rotator cuff injuries** – Damage or a tear to the group of muscles and tendons that surround the shoulder joint that connects to the humerus (upper arm bone).

**Ligament Injury** 

Ligaments are cords of tough, flexible fibrous tissue that connect bones together and provide support to a joint. While ligaments are extremely strong, an awkward stretch or twist can cause a strain injury. With enough force, they can be torn—the most severe ligament injury.

1. **Strains vs. Sprains**

   * **Sprains:** a stretch or tear of a ligament.

   * **Strains:** a twist, pull or tear of a muscle or tendon, commonly referred to as soft tissue. Tendons are the cords of tissue that connect muscles to bones.

   **Most Common Types of Ligament Injuries**

* Sprained Ankle: a stretch, micro tear or complete tear to the ligaments on the outer side of the ankle.

<!---->

*  Knee Ligament injuries: There are four ligaments that hold the bones of the knee together: Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL),  Medial Collateral Ligament (MCL), Lateral Collateral Ligament (LCL), & Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL)

<!---->

*  ** ACL Tear:** damage to the ligaments on the inside of the knee. The severity can range from a mild sprain to a full tear of the ligament(s). ACL tears frequently require surgery.

<!---->

* **MCL or LCL Tear:** a sprain or tear of the inner or outer knee ligaments. It is usually a result of an injury that occurs while participating in an activity that puts a heavy strain on the knees, such as skiing.  Most MCL and LCL injuries will recover without surgery

<!---->

* **PCL Tear:** Injury to the PCL is the least common type of ligament injury in the knee and frequently occurs from direct trauma or fall on the knee.  Most PCL injuries will heal without surgery.                                **Elbow Ligament Injuries:** the most common injury in the elbow; also known as the Tommy John injury. Injuries most commonly occur in baseball from excessive pitching and can be acute or chronic injuries. Traumatic tears can also occur in falls or sports such as wrestling. The UCL is on the inside of the elbow and injury can be a mild sprain, partial tear or complete tear.  

<!---->

* **Shoulder Ligament Injuries:** most commonly injured in dislocations of the ball and socket joint; are forceful injuries & frequently require an emergency room visit to have the joint reduced (put back into place). A shoulder Separation involves the Acromioclavicular Joint (ACJ) which is the outer part of the collar bone and involves tearing of the ligaments that hold the joint together 

<!---->

* **Thumb ligament injuries:** Gamekeepers thumb is a tear of the ligament between the base of the thumb and the wrist bones. These commonly occur during a fall when you’re holding something in your hand, such as a ski pole or the handlebars of a bike. 

#### Symptoms of a Ligament Injury

###### Torn ligament symptoms will vary depending on the severity of an injury to a tendon, but may include:

* Pain to the area, often sudden and severe

<!---->

* A loud pop or snapping sound at the time of the injury
* Swelling to the area of the injury
* Looseness of the joint
* Inability to move or put weight on the joint without pain
* Spasms in the muscles surrounding the injury

###### Mild ligament injuries can be treated with non-surgical treatment such as the R.I.C.E. method (Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation) and over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication. Sometimes a brace or splint is needed for comfort and protection. Your doctor may also recommend [physical therapy](https://www.bannerhealth.com/services/physical-therapy) as your treatment plan.

### Surgical Treatment

###### For severe strains or a tear to a ligament, a surgical procedure to repair the ligament may be required. Ligament surgery may consist of repairing or replacing the ligament. Sometimes a tendon graft is needed to hold the injured joint together. The tendon used may come from the injured person, known as an autograft, or may come from an organ donation, known as an allograft. Following surgical repair, physical therapy is almost always recommended.

###### Soft Tissue Injury: **any injury that causes damage to the skin, ligament or tendon. These injuries are classified as any trauma from an external force or overuse from physical activity that leads to an injury. For example, long-distance runners put a heavy amount of stress on their legs and feet. The result can often be trauma or strains to key areas of the lower leg like calf muscles or an Achilles tendon.There are various types of soft tissue injuries, commonly including:**

* Contusions – Commonly known as bruises
* Tendonitis – Inflammation, irritation or microscopic tears to the tendons
* Bursitis – Damage to the small, fluid-filled sacks that cushion the bones, muscles and tendons around the joints
* Stress injuries – Heavy stress to an area of soft tissue that results in pain and immobility
* Strains/Sprains – An injury to a muscle or tendon that is often caused by overstretching, hard force or overuse

###### Symptoms of a Soft Tissue Injury: the main symptom of any soft tissue injury will be pain to the injured part of the body, but pain may start somewhat mild and can often worsen over the first 48 hours following the injury. Other symptoms of soft tissue injuries can include:

* A knot or lump on or around the site of the injury
* Inability to put weight on the area
* Instability of the affected joint
* Muscle spasms or cramping
* Muscle weakness
* Swelling or bruising 

#### Soft Tissue Injuries Treatment

###### Immediate treatment should start with the R.I.C.E. method (Rest, Ice, Compression & Elevation.) Almost all soft tissue injuries cause some degree of swelling. Over the counter medications can help with pain and swelling. For a more severe soft tissue injury, prompt evaluation by a sports medicine provider is recommended.

#### Surgical Treatment

###### Severe soft tissue injuries may require surgical procedures to repair damage. Many of these surgeries can be performed arthroscopically, meaning a minimally invasive procedure where small incisions are made to repair damage. In most instances, these procedures are fairly quick and do not require an overnight hospital stay.
