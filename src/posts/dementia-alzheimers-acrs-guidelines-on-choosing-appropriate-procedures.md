1. For patients with cognitive decline and suspected Alzheimer's disease, the following procedures are usually appropriate:

   * MRI head without IV contrast (Radiation Level: O)
   * CT head without IV contrast (Radiation Level: ☢☢☢)
   * Amyloid PET/CT brain and FDG-PET/CT brain may also be appropriate (Radiation Level: ☢☢☢)
2. For patients suspected of frontotemporal dementia, the following procedures are usually appropriate:

   * MRI head without IV contrast (Radiation Level: O)
   * CT head without IV contrast (Radiation Level: ☢☢☢)
   * FDG-PET/CT brain may also be appropriate (Radiation Level: ☢☢☢)
3. For patients suspected of dementia with Lewy bodies, the following procedures are usually appropriate:

   * MRI head without IV contrast (Radiation Level: O)
   * CT head without IV contrast (Radiation Level: ☢☢☢)
   * Ioflupane SPECT or SPECT/CT brain and FDG-PET/CT brain may also be appropriate (Radiation Level: ☢☢☢)
4. For patients suspected of vascular dementia, the following procedures are usually appropriate:

   * MRI head without IV contrast (Radiation Level: O)
   * CT head without IV contrast (Radiation Level: ☢☢☢)
5. For patients suspected of idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus, the following procedures are usually appropriate:

   * MRI head without IV contrast (Radiation Level: O)
   * CT head without IV contrast (Radiation Level: ☢☢☢)
   * DTPA cisternography and HMPAO SPECT or SPECT/CT brain may also be appropriate (Radiation Level: ☢☢☢)

Please note that the radiation level is indicated by the symbol ☢, with more symbols indicating a higher level of radiation. The symbol O indicates no radiation.
